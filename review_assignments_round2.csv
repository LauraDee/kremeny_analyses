Recent rapid declines in hard coral cover have occurred across the Caribbean region, but the concomitant consequences for reef architecture have not been quantified on a large scale to date. We provide, to our knowledge, the first region-wide analysis of changes in reef architectural complexity, using nearly 500 surveys across 200 reefs, between 1969 and 2008. The architectural complexity of Caribbean reefs has declined nonlinearly with the near disappearance of the most complex reefs over the last 40 years. The flattening of Caribbean reefs was apparent by the early 1980s, followed by a period of stasis between 1985 and 1998 and then a resumption of the decline in complexity to the present. Rates of loss are similar on shallow (<6 m), mid-water (6-20 m) and deep (>20 m) reefs and are consistent across all five subregions. The temporal pattern of declining architecture coincides with key events in recent Caribbean ecological history: the loss of structurally complex Acropora corals, the mass mortality of the grazing urchin Diadema antillarum and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation-induced worldwide coral bleaching event. The consistently low estimates of current architectural complexity suggest regional-scale degradation and homogenization of reef structure. The widespread loss of architectural complexity is likely to have serious consequences for reef biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and associated environmental services.","43699",2009

Intercropping shade trees with coffee shrubs can produce multiple ecosystem services. Depending on the shade cover levels, however, the joint production of these services might be complementary or competitive based on their impacts on coffee yields. We develop a computational, bioeconomic model to find the range of shade level for which a coffee farmer is better off under. a shade-grown system compared to a sun-grown system, in the presence of coffee berry borer (CBB) infestations. We model the plant level provision of shade-induced pest control services, crop growth services, and timber, and consider in the baseline case a net price premium for shade-grown coffee. Using parameters from coffee regions in Colombia, our baseline simulation results indicate that, in the presence of a CBB infestation, the expected net present values in the shade-grown system can be higher but only for shade cover levels between 11% and 34%. The optimal shading level is 25% in the baseline scenario. It increases to 27% for greater values of crop growth ecosystem services and decreases to 20% in the absence of a price premium for shade-grown coffee.","FEB",2018

Aaron; Miller, Ian; Sweatman, Hugh","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","Many ecosystems face degradation unless factors that underpin their resilience can be effectively managed. In tropical reef ecosystems, grazing by herbivorous fishes can prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts that commonly signal loss of resilience. However, knowledge of grazing characteristics that most promote resilience is typically experimental, localized, and sparse, which limits broad management applications. Applying sound ecological theory to broad-scale data may provide an alternative basis for ecosystem management. We explore the idea that resilience is positively related to the diversity within and among functional groups of organisms. Specifically, we infer the relative vulnerability of different subregions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to phase shifts based on functional characteristics of the local herbivorous fish communities. Reef slopes on 92 reefs set in three zones of the continental shelf in eight latitudinal sectors of the GBR were surveyed on multiple occasions between 1995 and 2009. Spatial variation in fish community structure was high and driven primarily by shelf position. Measures of functional diversity, functional redundancy, and abundance were generally higher offshore and lower inshore. Two turbid inshore subregions were considered most vulnerable based on very low measures of herbivore function, and this was supported by the occurrence of phase shifts within one of three subregions. Eleven reefs that resisted phase shifts after major coral mortality included some with very low measures of herbivore function. The fact that phase shifts did not necessarily occur when large herbivores were scarce indicates that other environmental factors compensated to preserve resilience. Estimates of vulnerability based solely on herbivore function may thus prove conservative, but caution is appropriate, since compensatory factors are largely unknown and could be eroded unwittingly by anthropogenic stresses. Our data suggest that managing the threat of phase shifts in coral reef ecosystems successfully will require spatially explicit strategies that consider both the functional characteristics of local herbivore communities and environmental factors that may raise or lower resilience thresholds. A strong positive correlation between water clarity and the species richness and abundance of herbivorous fishes suggests that management of water quality is of generic importance to ensure the ecosystem services of this important group of herbivores.","JAN",2013

It is challenging to explicitly link the level of deposition on an ecosystem to the cascade of ecological effects triggered and ecosystem services affected, because of the multitude of possible pathways in the N cascade. To address this challenge, we report on the activities of an expert workshop to synthesize information on N-induced terrestrial eutrophication from the published literature and to link critical load exceedances with human beneficiaries by using the STressor- Ecological Production function final ecosystem Services Framework and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS). We found 21 N critical loads were triggered by N deposition (ranging from 2 to 39 kg N.ha(-1),yr(-1)), which cascaded to distinct beneficiary types through 582 individual pathways in the five ecoregions examined (Eastern Temperate Forests, Marine West Coast Forests, Northwestern Forested Mountains, North American Deserts, Mediterranean California). These exceedances ultimately affected 66 FEGS across a range of final ecosystem service categories (21 categories, e.g., changes in timber production, fire regimes, and native plant and animal communities) and 198 regional human beneficiaries of different types. Several different biological indicators were triggered in different ecosystems, including grasses and/or forbs (33% of all pathways), mycorrhizal communities (22%), tree species (21%), and lichen biodiversity (11%). Ecoregions with higher deposition rates for longer periods tended to have more numerous and varied ecological impacts (e.g., Eastern Temperate Forests, eight biological indicators) as opposed to other ecoregions (e.g., North American Deserts and Marine West Coast Forests each with one biological indicator). Nonetheless, although ecoregions differed by ecological effects from terrestrial eutrophication, the number of FEGS and beneficiaries impacted was similar across ecoregions. We found that terrestrial eutrophication affected all ecosystems examined, demonstrating the widespread nature of terrestrial eutrophication nationally. These results highlight which people and ecosystems are most affected according to present knowledge, and identify key uncertainties and knowledge gaps to be filled by future research.","JUL",2017

A monitoring program before and after restoration has been carried out in the study area located in the Yellow River Delta since 2001. Water quality, soil salinity. soil organic matter, plant community. and bird species were chosen as indicators in this program. During the past seven years, the restored wetland showed increasing efficiency in reducing water pollution levels. Soil quality was constantly improved through salinity reduction and soil organic matter accumulation. The vegetation community quickly re-established after the restoration was initiated in 2002. The restored vegetation communities provide favorable habitat conditions for birds and thirty-seven bird species were observed in October 2007. Based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plant species and vegetation community are mainly influenced by soil salinity and water depth. These indicate that conducting freshwater to the project area is an efficient measure for vegetation restoration. While monitoring results show that the restoration project had positive effects on the wetland ecosystem over the past seven years, two issues remain for future study: (1) the contribution of harvesting vegetation to stabilizing nutrient removal rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter in the soil; and (2) the effects of excessive propagation of Phragmites australis on spatial heterogeneity and plant diversity.

Prysor; Jones, Davey L.","ECOHYDROLOGY","Riparian buffers, the interface between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, have the potential to protect water bodies from land-based pollution, and also for enhancing the delivery of a range of ecosystem services. The UK currently has no defined optimal width or maximum extent of riparian buffers for specific ecosystem services. Here, we present the first study, which attempts to (a) compare and critique different riparian buffer delineation methods and (b) investigate how ecological processes, for example, pollutant removal, nutrient cycling, and water temperature regulation, are affected spatially by proximity to the river and also within a riparian buffer zone. Our results have led to the development of new concepts for riparian delineation based on ecosystem service-specific scenarios. Results from our study suggest that choice of delineation method will influence not only the total area of potential riparian buffers but also the proportion of land cover types included, which in turn will determine their main ecosystem provision. Thus, for some ecological processes (e.g., pollutant removal), a fixed-distance approach will preserve and protect its ecosystem function, whereas for processes such as denitrification, a variable-width buffer will reflect better riparian spatial variability maximizing its ecological value. In summary, riparian delineation within UK habitats should be specific to the particular ecosystem service(s) of interest (e.g., uptake of nutrients and shading), and the effectiveness of the buffer should be ground-truthed to ensure the greatest level of protection.","MAR",2018

Freerk; Buijs, Arjen E.; Vierikko, Kati","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","Biocultural diversity, which refers to the inextricable link between biodiversity and cultural diversity, has been predominantly associated with the traditional ways in which indigenous people in tropical countries interact with the natural environment. But it does not have to be restricted to these circumstances. Biocultural diversity may also be regarded as an interesting concept for understanding how people in industrialized and globalized societies deal with nature. This paper explores biocultural diversity in 20 European cities by considering (i) how biocultural diversity is interpreted in urban planning and governance, and (ii) what actual manifestations of biocultural diversity are present in these cities. Despite the fact that the concept of biocultural diversity was hardly recognized by city authorities, interviewees gave many examples of how biodiversity and cultural diversity are taken into account in (in) formal city policies. The research revealed two main manifestations of biocultural diversity within urban Europe: biocultural diversity grounded in ecological features, and cultural values as a basic foundation for biocultural diversity. Consequently, urban biocultural diversity was found to have two spatial levels: the city level and the site level. The former is the domain of governmental policy makers who discuss biocultural diversity in 'green space networks' in a rather static way. The latter is the domain where citizens participate in decisionmaking and the management of green spaces; it is here that cultural dynamics are most acknowledged.","DEC",2015

They are also the physical scenario where the nature-human interaction is more intense. The explicit relationships that link biodiversity, ES and HWB, and the direct and indirect causes responsible for their degradation, have been rarely explored. We used the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to explore the relationships between the river ecosystem and the Biobio Basin's social system. We selected 65 basin and regional-scale indicators to analyse the existing trends and associations among the different DPSIR components. The trend analysis results showed major biodiversity loss and how the regulating services and non-material goods of the HWB component deteriorated, while cultural services, direct and indirect pressures and institutional responses increased. The relationships among the different DPSIR components revealed biodiversity loss to be positively associated with cultural services, the material goods of the HWB component and pressures. Indirect drivers were negatively associated with regulating and cultural services, non-material goods and pressures. Institutional responses did not correlate with any DPSIR component. However, these results do not reflect the complexity of the Biobio Basin's socio-ecosystem. We estimate that the DPSIR framework shows a corseted and reductionist vision of a greater complexity than merely a unidirectional nature-human relationship. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

S. E. Zu; Gray, M. W.; Langdon, C. J.; Spalding, M. D.; Brumbaugh, R. D.","AQUATIC ECOLOGY","The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter, was formerly widespread in many US Pacific coast estuaries. Following dramatic declines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this species is now the focus of renewed restoration efforts. Restoration is undertaken for brood stock rehabilitation as well as a range of ecosystem services such as filtration; however, these ecosystem services are as yet poorly quantified. We present the first laboratory measurements of filtration rates (FR) for O. lurida, to which we fit a model of FR as a function of dry tissue weight and water temperature. We find that O. lurida has a FR at optimum temperature similar to previously established means across oyster species at 1 g dry tissue weight (DTW), but lower than many Crassostrea species. We also find that the allometric exponent relating FR to DTW in O. lurida is lower than the previously published mean across oyster species. Based on our derived filtration rates and historical data, we estimate the historic impact of filtration by O. lurida in five Pacific coast estuaries. We find that historic O. lurida populations did not have the capacity to filter the full volume of the estuary within the estuary residence time in any of the estuaries examined. This result is primarily driven by the low water temperatures and the short estuary residence times that typify the Pacific coast. We conclude that, unlike Crassostrea virginica Gmelin on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the Olympia oyster was not historically a dominant force in regulating seston concentrations at large scales in Pacific coast estuaries. Given the differences in the ecological role and habitat structure of these two oyster species, we recommend that analogies between them be drawn with caution. We discuss the implications of our results for developing restoration objectives.","JUN",2013

K.; Xu, P.; Yan, K.","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","Effective flood management measures incorporate the flood mitigation functions of natural ecosystems, but the exact functions and effects of forests, grasslands and other ecosystems in mitigating floods are not clearly understood. In this paper, a flood mitigation assessment model was established based on the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method, and the function and potential capacity of ecosystems for mitigating flooding in the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) were assessed. The monetary value of flood mitigation service was calculated by formulating an exponential function with respect to the amount of storm and flood damage. The results showed that ecosystems in the UYRB reduced flooding by a total of 42.8 billion cubic meters. Statistical equations developed for the amount of storm and flood damage gave an average of 6.479 billion RMB Yuan as the value of ecosystem flood mitigation in the UYRB. Despite their small cost, ecosystems have the potential to reduce flood damage by more than half, an indication of the important role of ecological systems in flood management. This approach can be used to identify high-value areas for ecological protection, and also to provide the governments at various levels with important information for decision-making related to integrated flood management.

One variety of eggplant exhibited a significantly reduced seed set in absence of pollinators, and two varieties significantly increased seed numbers when pollen deposition was enhanced. Two solitary bee species, Xylocopa caffra and Macronomia rufipes, were identified as effective pollinators of the crop. The visitation rates of these pollinators to eggplant flowers declined significantly with distance from the wild habitat. The importance of wild plants as alternative forage source for pollinators was assessed by a survey of the flowering plants in different habitats surrounding eggplant fields. While ruderal farm weeds provide much of these resources, the Acacia tortilis riverine forest experienced high visitation rates in one critical period of the dry season. The spatio-temporal foraging behaviour of eggplant pollinators highlights the role of the agricultural matrix in conserving ecosystem services. Interspersion of wild habitats with cultivated land promoted increased pollination services. (C) 2008 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the ability of annually harvested, unfertilized perennial systems to sustain long-term yields while also maintaining ecosystem services has not been widely studied. Here we compare the impacts of harvested perennial grass and annual crop fields on ecosystem functioning in KS, USA. Despite the lack of mineral fertilizer applications, the aboveground harvests of perennial fields yielded similar levels of N compared to those of conventional high-input wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields and at only 8% of the in-field energy costs. Their 75-yr cumulative N yield per ha was approximately 23% greater than that from the region's wheat fields. In terms of aboveground food webs, perennial fields harboured greater numbers and/or diversity of insect pollinators, herbivores and detritivores. Belowground, perennial grass fields maintained 43 Mg ha(-1) more soil carbon and 4 Mg ha(-1) more soil nitrogen than annual crop fields in the surface 1 m. Soil food webs in perennial fields, as indicated by nematode communities, exhibited greater food web complexity and stability than did those in annual crop fields. In surrounding watersheds, increased annual cropland was correlated with higher riverine nitrate-nitrogen levels.

Ecosystem functions and services may exhibit portfolio-type dynamics, whereby diversity within lower levels promotes stability at more aggregated levels. Portfolio theory provides a framework to characterize the relative performance among ecosystems and the processes that drive differences in performance. We assessed Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. portfolio performance across their native latitudinal range focusing on the reliability of salmon returns as a metric with which to assess the function of salmon ecosystems and their services to humans. We used the Sharpe ratio (e.g. the size of the total salmon return to the portfolio relative to its variability (risk)) to evaluate the performance of Chinook and sockeye salmon portfolios across the west coast of North America. We evaluated the effects on portfolio performance from the variance of and covariance among salmon returns within each portfolio, and the association between portfolio performance and watershed attributes. We found a positive latitudinal trend in the risk-adjusted performance of Chinook and sockeye salmon portfolios that also correlated negatively with anthropogenic impact on watersheds (e.g. dams and land-use change). High-latitude Chinook salmon portfolios were on average 25 times more reliable, and their portfolio risk was mainly due to low variance in the individual assets. Sockeye salmon portfolios were also more reliable at higher latitudes, but sources of risk varied among the highest performing portfolios.Synthesis and applications. Portfolio theory provides a straightforward method for characterizing the resilience of salmon ecosystems and their services. Natural variability in portfolio performance among undeveloped watersheds provides a benchmark for restoration efforts. Locally and regionally, assessing the sources of portfolio risk can guide actions to maintain existing resilience (protect habitat and disturbance regimes that maintain response diversity; employ harvest strategies sensitive to different portfolio components) or improve restoration activities.

The dominant taxa were Chlorophyta and streptophytic algae, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta. Metatranscriptomics provided insights into differences in community composition and into functional diversity via the relative share of taxa to the overall read abundance of distinct functional genes on the ecosystem level. The dominant metabolic pathways in terms of the fraction of expressed sequences in the cDNA libraries were affiliated with primary metabolism, specifically oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Our analyses indicate that community composition is a good first proxy for the analysis of ecosystem functions. However, differential gene regulation modifies the relative importance of taxa in distinct pathways. Whereas taxon composition varies considerably between lakes, the relative importance of distinct metabolic pathways is much more stable, indicating that ecosystem functioning is buffered against shifts in community composition through a functional redundancy of taxa.","DEC",2016

We collected soil samples (0-10 cm) at 266 sites within the Blue Cypress Marsh Conservation Area (4900 ha) in Florida that were analyzed for 18 different biogeochemical properties. Conditional sequential Gaussian simulation and principal component analysis was used to identify three major groups of behavior: (i) labile, fast response properties with fine-scale spatial auto correlation; (ii) stable, slow response properties with regional spatial autocorrelation; (iii) properties showing intermediate response.

Researchers use critical loads (CLs) to describe response thresholds, and recent studies on acid-sensitive biological indicators show that forests continue to be at risk from terrestrial acidification. However, rarely are impacts translated into changes in ""ecosystem services"" that impact human well-being. Further, the relevance of this research to the general public is seldom communicated in terms that can motivate action to protect valuable resources. To understand how changes in biological indicators affect human well-being, we used the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to quantitatively and qualitatively link CL exceedances to ecosystem service impacts. We specified the cause-and-effect ecological processes linking changes in biological indicators to final ecosystem services. The Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) was used within the STEPS Framework to classify the ecosystem component and the beneficiary class that uses or values the component. We analyzed two acid-sensitive tree species, balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white ash (Fraxinus americana), that are common in northeastern USA. These well-known species provide habitat for animals and popular forest products that are relatable to a broad audience. We identified 160 chains with 10 classes of human beneficiaries for balsam fir and white ash combined, concluding that there are resources at risk that the public may value. Two stories resulting from these explorations into the cascading effects of acid rain on terrestrial resources are ideal for effective science communication: the relationship between (1) balsam fir as a popular Christmas tree and habitat for the snowshoe hare, a favorite of wildlife viewers, and (2) white ash because it is used for half of all baseball bats, fine wood products, and musical instruments. Thus, rather than focusing on biological indicators that may only be understood or appreciated by specific stakeholders or experts, this approach extends the analysis to include impacts on FEGS and humans. It also lays the foundation for developing stakeholder-specific narratives, quantitative measures of endpoints, and for conducting demand-based valuations of affected ecosystem services.","JUN",2017

However, urban expansion leads to urban ecosystem changes and hence directly threatens carbon storage. Therefore, modelling the potential impacts of urban expansion on carbon storage is necessary. This study links the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) model and the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to analyze the potential impacts of urban expansion on carbon storage in Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration from 2014 to 2023 under three urban expansion scenarios, namely Natural Increase Scenario (NIS), Cultivated Protection Scenario (CPS), and Ecological Protection Scenario (EPS). The results indicated (1) carbon storage of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration experienced a loss of 8.64 Tg from 1995 to 2009; (2) from 2014 to 2023, the carbon storage will experience the most loss of 8.54 Tg under the NIS, will experience the least loss of 7.12 Tg under the EPS, and will experience moderate loss of 7.92 Tg under the CPS; (3) the conversions of green land ecosystem and cultivated ecosystem to built-up ecosystem are the main cause of regional carbon storage loss in Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration; (4) the carbon storage loss will primarily occur in the junction region of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration because every city is incline to expand toward other cities in an urban agglomeration system.

However, little is known about how subjective wellbeing, in particular, is impacted by invasive species. This is troubling because it precludes credible empirical considerations of the full-range of social externalities when setting invasive species management policy. To address this knowledge gap, this paper provides the first estimates of invasive species impacts on subjective well-being using the life satisfaction (""happiness"") index. The approach is applied to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a particularly virulent ash tree attacking pest in North America. Using a repeated cross-sectional fixed effects design, the impact of EAB detection on life satisfaction (LS) is estimated for individuals living in 189 counties in 15 US states over 2005-2011. Results suggest that after EAB detection, LS is reduced by 0.127 on a 4-point scale [95% CI: -0.002, -0.252]. The magnitude of impacts are greatest after a 5-year lag and are largest among young adults (18-24 years). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","APR",2017

Marked biodiversity change due to growing pressures on the world's ecosystems is now well documented. However, the hypothesis that dominant species are becoming relatively more abundant has not been tested. We examined the prediction that the dominance structure of contemporary communities is shifting, using a meta-analysis of 110 assemblage timeseries. Changes in relative and absolute dominance were evaluated with mixed and cyclic-shift permutation models. Our analysis uncovered no evidence of a systematic change in either form of dominance, but established that relative dominance is preserved even when assemblage size (total N) changes. This suggests that dominance structure is regulated alongside richness and assemblage size, and highlights the importance of investigating multiple components of assemblage diversity when evaluating ecosystem responses to environmental drivers.","JUN",2018

The current study describes the community assemblage pattern of macrophytes and their variations within and among areas affected by environmental disturbances in Ponnani Kole wetland system. The macrophyte community structures in the study site were characterized with reference to areas of saline intrusion, intense agricultural activities and sewage disposal. Sphaeranthus africanus and Colocasia esculenta were specific to sewage; Rotala indica, Hedyotis corymbosa, Limnophila heterophylla and Eriocaulon setaceum were specific to agriculture; while, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Mariscus dubius were specific to areas of saline intrusion in the study site. Mean diversity did not vary significantly among the different zones of disturbance with the exception of saline intruded areas. Taxonomically, similar species flourished well in all regions of the study except in the saline intrusion area. In undisturbed areas, considered as control, the occurrence of all macrophytes was observed in equal proportions with the exception of mangroves and suspended hydrophytes. However, in sewage disposal areas, the occurrence of 45 species was observed with unequal predominance of all taxa, viz. class, order and family of macrophytes. The implementation of decision supporting tools to aid strategy and policy makers explore land-use options and disturbance scenarios along with ecological tools assessing multiple ecosystem services will see Ponnani Kole wetland become established as a macrophyte dominated ecological regime which can be further developed as a conservation and educational site for tropical aquatic macrophytes.","AUG",2018

However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

In cultural landscapes undergoing land use extensification, rewilding has been proposed as a viable approach to reverse biodiversity loss through reducing human impacts. The world's largest ecological restoration campaign is taking place on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to combat grassland degradation and enhance the upper stream region's water retention capacity. However, little is known about whether the large-scale rewilding also benefits the unique bird assemblage of the eastern QTP. Our study aims to make science-based conservation recommendations for the Tibetan avifauna by detecting their diversity and endemism distribution patterns at the local scale. In the breeding seasons of 2014 and 2015, we carried out bird surveys and conducted a habitat mapping using three Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We developed a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D habitat feature parameters from the high-resolution (10 cm level) UAV-derived images. Meanwhile, we employed the participatory GIS approach to acquire farm-scale human land-use data. Our results indicate that the distributions of avian diversity, endemism and abundance are not congruent across the eastern QTP, which calls for the conservation of different habitat types. Vertical and horizontal habitat heterogeneity maintain the local bird diversity with anthropogenic elements significantly enriching the overall bird abundance. Degraded pastures provided key habitats for two highly abundant endemic passerines the White-rumped Snowfinch Ortychosmuthus taczanowskii and the Ground Tit Pseudopodoces humilis. At the landscape scale, historical human-nature interactions between Tibetan nomads and the alpine environment formed the landscapes patchy vegetation structure. Our results reveal that the Tibetan cultural landscape maintains the structural heterogeneity needed to achieve multiple bird conservation objectives on the eastern QTP. Restoring the cultural landscape to a 'natural' tall-grass or dense-shrubland state of high water-retention capacity may result in the loss of both high-abundance avian communities and endemic species diversity. Our empirical study also indicated that rewilding abandoned agricultural landscape will not necessarily lead to a desired conservation outcome, especially when the requirements of habitat specialists and endemics are not taken into account. Moreover, ecological restoration projects should evaluate the divergences between their ecosystem service and biodiversity objectives.","AUG",2018

The impoundment substantially increased the intensity and severity of droughts downstream, and may have produced a cluster of impacts on the changing landscape.

While much recent work has been conducted, relatively few studies relating functional ecology to ecosystem services has utilized field experiments, particularly for animal species. We used a functional diversity (FD) approach to study the effect of bird traits on the control of the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and the effect of canopy cover management on bird FD. We conducted an exclosure experiment to test the effect of bird FD on the difference of H. hampei infestation rates between coffee shrubs both exposed to, and excluded from bird foraging activity. We addressed the following questions: (1) is avian FD, at the plot level, a good predictor of H. hampei infestation? (2) do gleaner bird species contribute to the control of the pest? and (3) how does shade management affect avian FD? We found that (1) all four FD indices calculated using bird traits were significant predictors of H. hampei differences in infestation rates, (2) richness of gleaning bird species was also a significant predictor of differences in H. hampei infestation rates, and (3) the interaction between month and canopy cover management affects bird FD, however whether this affects delivery of the pest control service remains unclear due to the particular biology of H. hampei. In revealing the connection between avian traits and the removal and potential control of H. hampei, our study highlights the importance of bird diversity persisting in agricultural landscapes, and the necessity of integrating bird conservation to foster healthy production systems.

We investigated the impact of disturbance (fire, topsoil removal) on the composition, biomass, and water storage capacity of bryophytes in indigenous temperate tall-tussock grasslands managed to sustain an ecosystem service (regular provision of water) to nearby urban areas. We surveyed bryophyte composition, structure and water-related traits 9 years after experimental fires and topsoil removal. Total water storage capacity of non-epiphytic bryophytes in control grassland sites was estimated at 4.3 mm, a value similar to that found in temperate New Zealand forests. Total biomass, species composition, and water-related traits were the main drivers of water storage potential from bryophytes. A major shift in bryophyte species composition following disturbances reduced this potential by over 80%. Bryophyte community changed from a dense ground cover (71%) of the pleurocarpous moss Hypnum cupressiforme with high water holding capacity (c. 1400% of dry mass) in control plots, to low frequency of the colonist moss Polytrichum juniperinum in burned plots, and two Campylopus species in areas with topsoil removed for firebreaks (all three displaying a low water holding capacity of less than 800% dry mass). We concluded that despite their low species diversity (12 species in total in undisturbed sites), bryophytes form a major, previously unrecognised; component of indigenous tall-tussock grasslands in New Zealand, and contribute towards sustaining the valued water holding capacity of these systems. Like the tussock dominants, bryophytes and their associated ecological functions are highly susceptible to long-term impacts from burning and vegetation clearance. It is therefore critical to account for the recovery of bryophytes in the management of indigenous tall-tussock grasslands to maintain healthy ecosystems.",NA,2013

Accordingly, there has been growing interest in what drives resilience to climatic disturbances. When a disturbance overwhelms the resistance of an ecosystem, it becomes vulnerable during recovery, with implications for ecosystem function and persistence. Understanding what influences ecosystem recovery is particularly important in seagrass ecosystems because of their functional roles, vulnerability, and divergent recovery strategies. Seagrass cover was monitored for 3 yr following a large, heatwaveassociated mortality event in Shark Bay, Australia. Although the ecosystem's historically dominant foundational seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, is capable of rapid disturbance recovery, this did not occur, likely because of the failure of mechanisms which have driven rapid recovery in other systems (persistence of rhizome beds, sexual reproduction among neighboring beds). Instead, a tropical early successional seagrass, Halodule uninervis, became more common, increasing diversity. These changes in the structure of the Shark Bay seagrass ecosystem, and reduction of biomass and structural complexity, will have important implications for ecosystem services and community dynamics and indicates that this ecosystem is highly vulnerable to future disturbances. More generally, our work suggests that seagrass ecosystems typified by a mix of early and late successional species may be particularly likely to exhibit a mismatch between recovery of cover per se and recovery of function following disturbance. As such, extreme climatic events have the potential to abruptly alter seagrass community dynamics and ecosystem services.","43537",2017

Successional stage is likely to influence forest productivity and carbon storage, linking the degree of forest disturbance to the global carbon cycle and climate. Although tropical montane forests are an important part of tropical forest ecosystems (ca. 8 %, elevation > 1000m a.s.l.), there are still significant knowledge gaps regarding the carbon dynamics and stocks of these forests, and how these differ between early (ES) and late successional (LS) stages. This study examines the carbon (C) stock, relative growth rate (RGR) and net primary production (NPP) of ES and LS forest stands in an Afromontane tropical rainforest using data from inventories of quantitatively important ecosystem compartments in fifteen 0.5 ha plots in Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda. The total C stock was 35% larger in LS compared to ES plots due to significantly larger above-ground biomass (AGB; 185 and 76MgC ha(-1) in LS and ES plots), while the soil and root C stock (down to 45 cm depth in the mineral soil) did not significantly differ between the two successional stages (178 and 204MgC ha(-1) in LS and ES plots). The main reasons for the difference in AGB were that ES trees had significantly lower stature and wood density compared to LS trees. However, ES and LS stands had similar total NPP (canopy, wood and roots of all plots similar to 9.4MgC ha(-1)) due to counterbalancing effects of differences in AGB (higher in LS stands) and RGR (higher in ES stands). The AGB in the LS plots was considerably higher than the average value reported for old-growth tropical montane forest of south-east Asia and Central and South America at similar elevations and temperatures, and of the same magnitude as in tropical lowland forest of these regions. The results of this study highlight the importance of accounting for disturbance regimes and differences in wood density and allometry of tree species dominating at different successional stages in an attempt to quantify the C stock and sink strength of tropical montane forests and how they may differ among continents.","43539",2017

We studied the supplies of four ecosystem services: grain provisioning, meat provisioning, water conservation, and soil retention at the county level in the Jinghe watershed in northwestern China. The spatial differences of the supply of four ecosystem services were studied using two indices, the Total Ecosystem Services (TES) and Trade-Offs (TO) indices. Then, the environmental and land use factors affecting the spatial differences were also analyzed. The results show that large spatial differences exist in the supplies of multiple ecosystem services, in which the TES and TO indices varied by as much as six and 12 times from one area to another, respectively. Precipitation was the primary constraint on the total supply of multiple ecosystem services. However, environmental factors had little impact on the ecosystem service tradeoffs, although the type of land use had significant impacts. An increase in the spatial extent of grassland area resulted in reduced trade-offs and enhanced the supply of multiple ecosystem services. A spatial increase in farmland had opposite effects.

In this study, six landscape services (food supply, habitat maintenance, habitat connectivity, soil retention, landscape aesthetics, and population carrier) were quantified in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China. Then, Spearman's rank correlation, partial correlation, principal component analysis and geographically weighted regression were used to identify the driving forces of agricultural landscape multifunctionality. The results showed that agricultural landscape multifunctionality generally increased during 2000-2010. The vegetation factor of NDVI was the most important natural indicator influencing landscape multifunctionality, while the gross domestic product was the most related social indicator. In a spatial non-stationary background, the vegetation component positively influenced multifunctionality; the impacts of the social component were negative in the center of the study area, but positive in the north and east.

However, the conditions under which natural habitats provide protection have been controversial, partly because the geomorphic, ecological, and hydrodynamic factors that determine wave attenuation vary greatly among locations, times, and studies. We re-analyzed existing wave attenuation studies in kelp, mangrove, marsh and seagrass habitats and found that much of the variation in wave attenuation can be explained by differences in vegetation characteristics and by the change in bulk drag with flow conditions. We found that vegetation can exert substantial drag on passing waves, but that the bulk drag coefficient declines in flow conditions characterized by high Reynolds numbers. This decline is important because storm conditions are highly turbulent (typical Reynolds numbers are greater than 10 4), and we lack empirical measurements of bulk drag coefficients from such conditions. Failing to account for the decline can over-estimate wave attenuation in storms by 19% to 1600%. These results suggest that larger habitat areas will need to be set aside for coastal protection than previously thought. Our approach provides predictions for designing practical habitat conservation and restoration plans that also protect humans and property from flooding and erosion.","AUG",2013

Results were grouped by functional guilds to infer potential impacts on ecosystem services, and to relate model transferability (i.e., ability of our models to be generalized to other times and scales) to specific functional and life-history traits. Overall, our models were able to accurately predict, both in space and time, habitat suitability for 69% of species, especially for granivorous, nonmigrant, tree-nesting species, and species that are tied to agricultural areas under intensive use. These findings indicate that model transferability depends upon specific functional and life-history traits, providing further evidence that species' ecologies affect the ability of models to accurately predict bird distributions. Declining bird species were mostly short-distance migrants that were associated with open habitats (agricultural and nonproductive forest) with aerial insectivorous or granivorous diets, which may be related to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Land-use changes were positive for some forest bird species that were mainly associated with mixed and deciduous forests, generalist diets and tree-nesting strategies. Yet cavity-nesting birds have suffered substantial reductions in their distributions, suggesting that cumulative effects of intensive logging and wildfires on mature forests pose a threat for forest-specialist species. Habitat suitability changes predicted by our coarse-scale species distribution models partially agreed with the long-term trends reported by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Our findings confirm land-use change as a key driving force for shaping bird communities in southern Quebec, together with the need to explicitly incorporate it into global change scenarios that better inform decision-makers on conservation and management.","OCT",2018

The primary producers of most land-based ecosystems are propagated by and maintained through various mechanisms of seed dispersal that involve both abiotic and biotic modes of transportation. By far the most common biotic seed transport mechanism is zoochory,wherebyseeds, or fruits containing them, are dispersed through the activities of animals. Rodents are one group of mammals that commonly prey on seeds (granivores) and play a critical, often destructive, role in primary dispersal and the dynamics of plant communities. In North America, geomyid, heteromyid and some sciurid rodents have specialized cheek pouches for transporting seeds from plant source to larder, where they are often eliminated from the pool of plant propagules by consumption. These seed-laden rodents are commonly consumed by snakes as they forage, but unlike raptors, coyotes, bobcats, and other endothermic predators which eat rodents and are known or implicated to be secondary seed dispersers, the role of snakes in seed dispersal remains unexplored. Here, using museum-preserved specimens, we show that in nature three desert-dwelling rattlesnake species consumed heteromyids with seeds in their cheek pouches. By examining the entire gut we discovered, furthermore, that secondarily ingested seeds can germinate in rattlesnake colons. In terms of secondary dispersal, rattlesnakes are best described as diplochorous. Because seed rescue and secondary dispersal in snakes has yet to be investigated, and because numerous other snake species consume granivorous and frugivorous birds and mammals, our observations offer direction for further empirical studies of this unusual but potentially important channel for seed dispersal.","43510",2018

Surprisingly little is known about the effects of such disturbances on complex agroecosystems with multiple interacting species. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of management by pesticide spraying on the productive outputs and the ecological functioning of a cacao agroecosystem. We built a mechanistic dynamic model including the dynamics of the crop, a pest (Cacao Pod Borer, Conopomorpha cramerella) and two beneficial insects: a hymenopteran egg-parasitoid and a ceratopogonid pollinator. Using this model, we tested the effects of a range of pesticide types characterized by their impacts on both the Cacao Pod Borer and the beneficial insects. Our results showed that yield strongly varies according to both pesticide type and timing of pesticide application. The type of pesticide had a strong influence on the flexibility of management. No simple spraying decision rule led to maximal yields for all types of pesticide. Although optimal spraying strategies differed with the type of pesticide used, they all showed a similar pattern, i.e. they limited and postponed the Cacao Pod Borer population peak while limiting the negative impacts on beneficial organisms. The results highlight the non-trivial effects of pesticide application in complex agroecosystems where associated biodiversity provides both ecosystem services and disservices. They illustrate the critical importance of providing good information to farmers on pesticide management because the use of pesticides can have a negative effect on production by decreasing ecosystem services such as pollination.","MAR",2013

Promoting ecosystem services, such as biological pest control, could help to reduce pesticide inputs while simultaneously sustaining a high productivity. The highly intensive rice production in Southeast Asia, where more than 20% of the world's rice yield is produced, is challenged by devastating losses each year due to rice hoppers. This poses a great threat to the more than 3.5 billion people depending on rice as staple food. Egg parasitoids are among the most important natural enemies of rice hoppers and might be promoted with effective habitat management. However, empirical studies that focus on the management of parasitoid populations to enhance biological pest control in rice agroecosystems are largely lacking. We therefore analysed the effects of the availability of diverse habitats on hopper parasitoid performance, parasitism rates and pest control services, hypothesising that egg parasitoid abundance and pest control is positively influenced by diverse non-crop areas, which provide food resources as well as retreat areas for the fallow season. We experimentally tested the efficiency and abundance of egg parasitoids of Nilaparvata lugens and Nephotettix spp. in three study sites representing different levels of floral resources over the course of two rice growing seasons. We used mixed effect models to test whether habitat diversity positively influenced parasitoid abundance and subsequently reduces hatching rates of the hopper nymphs. Nephotettix spp. eggs were parasitized by Gonatocerus spp. and Paracentrobia spp. by 92.5%; Nilaparvata lugens eggs were parasitized by Oligosita spp. and Anagrus spp by 93%. In contrast to our hypothesis, we could demonstrate that additional floral resources do not significantly enhance parasitoid abundance and pest control in rice agroecosystems. Up to six times more parasitoids hatched-from the bait plants exposed in the monoculture compared to the non-crop areas (p < 0.05). All parasitoid genera except Anagrus spp. were found in rice fields in triple or quadruple numbers compared to the non-crop habitats (p < 0.05). This was true also during the fallow period (p < 0.05), where only ratoon rice was available to sustain hopper populations. In contrast to our hypotheses and findings from temperate productions systems, we found higher parasitoid abundance during all crop stages and increased hatching rates in the monocultures than in the non-crop habitats. The structural and temporal heterogeneity of rice crops and ratoon rice within the production area seemed to be sufficient to sustain high densities of parasitoid populations. We conclude that ecological intensification schemes should implement asynchronous planting cycles in rice systems to maintain or enhance parasitoids populations and their biocontrol services. In combination with reduced pesticide inputs, these measures might help to avoid yield losses due to rice hoppers in the future.","43511",2018

Ecological infrastructure such as urban rivers and their catchments may enhance biodiversity, ecological functioning and ecosystem service delivery within cities. Birds are good indicators of urban habitat quality because their ecology is well-studied and they are habitat selective. This study assesses the ecological value of a small urban river catchment in Cape Town, South Africa, in terms of its effect on the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds. 178 bird counts were carried out at 89 sites and 95 species were recorded. The nine functional groups considered were present in equal proportions in the catchment and in the whole of southern Africa, making the catchment a microcosm of the region's avifauna in terms of functional composition. Using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, we showed that the river was responsible for the occurrence of certain species and functional groups that would not otherwise occur in the suburbs. Nutrient movers, insectivores, scavengers and seed dispersers responded strongly to a gradient of distance from the river and the position on the river. Contrary to the homogenised assemblage that might be expected of an urban area, the catchment contains a taxonomically and functionally diverse bird assemblage. The combination of a river, a heterogeneous urban matrix and an adjacent national park makes this catchment an exemplar of the value of ecological infrastructure for urban biodiversity.

Social-ecological vulnerability offers a valuable framework for identifying and understanding important social-ecological linkages, and the implications of dependencies and other feedback loops in the system. Unfortunately, its implementation at local scales has hitherto been limited due at least in part to the lack of operational tools for spatial representation of social-ecological vulnerability. We developed a method to map social-ecological vulnerability based on information on human-nature dependencies and ecosystem services at local scales. We applied our method to the small-scale fishery of Moorea, French Polynesia, by combining spatially explicit indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of both the resource (i.e., vulnerability of reef fish assemblages to fishing) and resource users (i.e., vulnerability of fishing households to the loss of fishing opportunity). Our results revealed that both social and ecological vulnerabilities varied considerably through space and highlighted areas where sources of vulnerability were high for both social and ecological subsystems (i.e., social-ecological vulnerability hotspots) and thus of high priority for management intervention. Our approach can be used to inform decisions about where biodiversity conservation strategies are likely to be more effective and how social impacts from policy decisions can be minimized. It provides a new perspective on human-nature linkages that can help guide sustainability management at local scales; delivers insights distinct from those provided by emphasis on a single vulnerability component (e.g., exposure); and demonstrates the feasibility and value of operationalizing the social-ecological vulnerability framework for policy, planning, and participatory management decisions.","APR",2018

Our objective was to describe their spatial distribution and interactions and also to analyze whether they formed specific bundle types on a regional scale in the Danish cultural landscape. We found clustered distribution patterns of ecosystem services across the country. There was a significant tendency for trade-offs between on the one hand cultural and regulating services and on the other provisioning services, and we also found the potential of regulating and cultural services to form synergies. We identified six distinct ecosystem service bundle types, indicating multiple interactions at a landscape level. The bundle types showed specialized areas of agricultural production, high provision of cultural services at the coasts, multifunctional mixed-use bundle types around urban areas and forest recreation bundle types with high hunting potential. Thus we found that the distributions were both determined by historical and current socio-ecological influences. This gives a better understanding of the interactions between multiple services in the landscape and the way the landscape has been managed. However, the number, types and spatial distribution of such bundles are quite sensitive to the individual ecosystem services selected and the input data available to define these services. This should be taken into consideration in further research on how to utilize the existing synergies and the mitigating potential of trade-offs for a more holistic approach to landscape-scale ecosystem service management.

M.; Korthals, Gerard W.; Rutgers, Michiel; Schouten, Anton J.; Creamer, Rachel","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","The ecosystem services that humans obtain from the soil are strongly linked to the soil's biota. There is ample evidence that intensive agriculture has a negative effect on the soil's biological diversity. While in other ecosystems, habitat specialists are at a higher risk of extinction due to human impacts than generalists, we have no evidence of whether this holds true for soil biota. We calculated the realized niche width for soil nematodes using co-occurrence data. We compared these with ecological traits. We then calculated an index of community specialization and tested whether land use intensity leads to decreases in the index of community specialization, taxon richness, diversity and to changes in nematode abundance. The resulting realized niche widths did not correlate with ecological traits such as feeding group, body mass or c-p class. While it is possible that there are no relationships between these traits and the realized niche width, it is likelier that food availability, pH tolerance, or host breadth are more important factors in explaining niche width. Contrary to our expectations, the lowest community specialization levels were found in soils with the lowest human intervention (shrubland-woodland ecosystems), while grasslands, dairy farms and arable farms had an overall higher level of specialization. Weather variables and land use intensity explained 66% of the variation in the index of community specialization in sandy soils. We found highest richness and diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance (grasslands and dairy farms). The lowest abundances were found on shrubland-woodland systems. Dairy farms on sand and clay had similar indices of community specialization, whereas peaty soils fostered a higher proportion of habitat specialists. We argue that farmland supposes a stable environment for organisms with shorter life spans. Agricultural management strives to lower disturbances, allowing shorter lived organisms to escape pressures otherwise present in nature, such as drought or nutrient deficiencies during the growing season. In very disturbed systems, however, specialists may also suffer from negative effects of land use intensity. This co-occurrence method to assess niche width opens the door to estimating the soil community's niche breadth, for which resource-based methods are difficult to implement.

Bacteria are prime providers of essential ecosystem services, representing an excellent model system to perform biodiversity-ecosystem function research. By using bacteria isolated from petroleum-contaminated sites, we show that communities composed of poorly related species were more productive than those containing highly related species. The nature of the forces controlling this positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on community productivity depended on the number of species in culture. In communities of two species the positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on productivity was driven by changes in the selection effect. Communities of two distantly related species were dominated by the most productive species in monoculture, whereas communities of two closely related species were dominated by the less productive species in monoculture. In communities of four species the positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on productivity was driven by changes in the complementarity effect. In communities composed of four distantly related species the influence of positive interactions such as facilitation, cross-feeding, and niche partitioning seemed to outweigh the influence of negative interactions such as interference. As a consequence the proportion of species favored by the presence of other species increased as they became less related. Multiple facets of biodiversity may influence ecosystem functioning. Here, we present evidence of an interaction between phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity on community productivity, underlining the importance of considering multiple aspects of biodiversity when studying its impact on ecosystem functioning.","NOV",2013

A series of ecological restoration strategies have been implemented to enhance the ecosystem services of China's grasslands. To understand the response of ecosystem C and N to grazing exclusion within a nationwide conservation project-Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands (RGLG), the C and N storages in different parts of the plant-soil system as well as soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) contents were determined and compared between three grazing exclusion sites (6 years) and the paired adjacent grazing sites in the Hulunbuir grassland of Inner Mongolia. Our results showed that the exclusion of grazing for 6 years resulted in significant increases of ecosystem biomass and soil C and N contents, leading to a substantial restoration of ecosystem C and N storage. The average C and N accumulation rates in the whole ecosystem were 173.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 19.8 g N m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The accumulation of C and N in soil contributed to more than 87.6% and 98.2% of the increases in ecosystem C and N, respectively, indicating that the restoration of ecosystem C and N were mainly due to the increase of C and N in soil after exclusion of grazing. The higher MBC and MBN in exclosure sites than grazing sites might be partly because of the enhanced organic matter inputs from plant litter and root exudates. The significant correlations between soil organic matter and microbial biomass suggested that soil microbial biomass could be a sensitive indicator of the soil C and N dynamics. These results indicated that exclusion of grazing pressure within the RGLG project is an effective restoration approach to control grassland degradation in this region. However, more comprehensive multidisciplinary studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the RGLG project and to improve the management strategies for grassland restoration.

Insectivorous birds are increasingly recognized for the crucial pest control services they provide to agroecosystems. While both the foraging activity and functional diversity of birds are enhanced by multiscale habitat heterogeneity, little is known about how these relationships may influence avian top-down control of insects. Specifically, interactive effects of bird community structure and habitat heterogeneity on pest control across spatial scales have rarely been explored. 2. We sampled bird communities and measured avian predation on plasticine model prey, as a proxy for lepidopteran pest control, in 20 vineyards of south-western France. Vineyards differed both in sward heterogeneity at the local scale and amount of surrounding semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale. Functional diversity metrics and community-weighted mean traits were computed for bird communities based on a species-trait table including diet, foraging method, nesting site, migration strategy, laying date, home range size, clutch size and body mass. We used mixed models to test for the interacting effects of habitat heterogeneity and bird functional diversity on avian predation rates of plasticine prey. 3. Contrary to expectations, bird functional diversity decreased with landscape-scale heterogeneity, but was higher in vineyards managed with heterogeneous sward structures. In contrast, foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant in landscapes supporting more semi-natural habitats, suggesting an increase in their contribution to pest control along the landscape heterogeneity gradient. Accordingly, we found that avian predation on plasticine prey increased with bird functional evenness both in more heterogeneous vineyards at the local scale and in landscape mosaics supporting more semi-natural habitats. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales influenced avian insectivory in vineyard agroecosystems by interacting with bird community structure. It provides important insights for ecological intensification in vineyards, pointing out that management options need to be adapted to both the functional composition of local bird communities and landscape context. We suggest that both on-field and off-field management can be used to enhance natural pest control services provided by birds in vineyards, especially by favouring sward heterogeneity and patches of semi-natural habitats within large vineyard stands at the landscape scale.","APR",2017

We revisited one of the earliest ecosystem experiments in North America: the 1963 de-vegetation of a forested catchment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. Potential benefits of the regulation of water flow, water quality, greenhouse gases, and forest growth were compared between experimental (WS 2) and reference (WS 6) watersheds over a 30-year period. Both watersheds exhibited similarly high capacity for flow regulation, in part because functional loads remained low (i.e., few major storm events) during the de-vegetation period. Drought mitigation capacity, or the maintenance of flows sufficient to satisfy municipal water consumption, was higher in WS 2 due to reduced evapotranspiration associated with loss of plant cover. We also assessed watershed capacity to regulate flows to satisfy different beneficiaries, including hypothetical flood averse and drought averse types. Capacity to regulate water quality was severely degraded during de-vegetation, as nitrate concentrations exceeded drinking water standards on 40% of measurement days. Once forest regeneration began, WS 2 rapidly recovered the capacity to provide safe drinking water, and subsequently mitigated the eutrophication potential of rainwater at a marginally higher level than WS 6. We estimated this additional pollution removal benefit would have to accrue for approximately 65-70 years to offset the net eutrophication cost incurred during forest removal. Overall, our results affirmed the critical role of forest vegetation in water regulation, but also indicated trade-offs associated with forest removal and recovery that partially depend on larger-scale exogenous changes in climate forcing and pollution inputs. We also provide a starting point for integrating long-term ecological research and modeling data into ecosystem services science.","OCT",2015

A.","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","A major strategy to increase the sustainability of agricultural systems consists of enhancing internal ecosystem processes that support crop production and reduce external resource inputs. However, specific approaches to achieve this goal still need to be identified. Here, we investigated whether inoculation with a high dose of a well characterized strain of a plant symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus into Swiss corn fields leads to successful establishment of the fungus in plant roots and can generate agronomic benefits for maize production. We used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing to assess community composition of native AM fungi and identified environmental management and biological factors affecting AM fungal abundance, establishment success of the introduced fungus and effects of AMF inoculation on corn yield. While native AM fungal abundance was negatively related to soil P contents, we found significantly positive relationships between soil P contents and establishment success of the inoculated fungus. There was a significantly negative relationship between inoculum establishment and abundance of native AM fungi. Although molecular quantification using strain-specific qPCR indicated that the inoculated strain strongly increased in abundance in roots from most soils investigated, total AM fungal root colonization was only significantly increased in one soil, indicating successful competition of the inoculant for root niche space against native AM fungi. Positive effects on corn yield were only observed when inoculation increased root colonization and were negatively correlated to P fertilization levels. The results imply that phosphorus plays a major role in defining the abundance of native AM fungi and the composition of their communities and that these effects can determine establishment success of the inoculant. The results further indicate that positive effects on crop yield may only be expected when potentially achievable root colonization levels are not yet reached and AMF communities are not well developed.","43525",2019

Here we investigate the rarely studied phenomenon of early-season crop colonization by parasitoids and the relationship with the surrounding landscape. We assessed parasitism of whiteflies by placing whitefly infested cotton seedlings in remnant vegetation, arable land 25-125 m from remnant vegetation, and arable land further than 400 m from remnant vegetation. Twelve to twenty sentinel plants were exposed in a 25 x 25 m grid pattern in plots in each habitat. The experiment was conducted at 18 locations across two landscapes and repeated three times in a 2-week period in 2007 and 2008. Parasitism was observed during the first three days after the introduction of the whitefly infested seedlings and was in all cases caused by Encarsia spp. The mean number of parasitized whitefly per plant was 0.106 +/- 0.025 and was highest on cotton plants placed in remnant vegetation, declining with increasing distance from remnant vegetation. A regression model with land use and meteorological variables received more statistical support from the data than models with only landscape and time period as factors. Parasitism levels were influenced by the proportion of remnant vegetation, grassland, as well as wind, temperature, dew point temperature and year. Early-season colonization of whitefly infested seedlings by parasitoids was erratic and characterized by large spatial (inter-plant and inter-plot) and temporal variation. Our study confirms that remnant vegetation function as reservoirs for parasitoids and that parasitoids can penetrate arable fields beyond 125 m within 3 days. However, variation in the occurrence of parasitism makes it difficult to predict parasitoid colonization at a specific place and time. Therefore, field-based scouting for pests and parasitoids is necessary, even in landscapes with a high biocontrol potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","43709",2015

Natural habitats adjacent to agricultural areas are often considered sources of species that provide beneficial regulating ecosystem services through cross-habitat spillover. Both inter-habitat matrix and landscape configuration can influence spillover by controlling organismal ability to disperse through landscapes, and affecting the provision of additional or supplementary resources that impact organism survival. 2. To understand how landscape structure in terms of matrix land use type, forest cover and edge density might facilitate avian cross-habitat spillover, we sampled avian communities in forest patches and adjacent land use types (coffee plantations or cattle pastures) using a well-replicated study design across 92 sampling sites across a landscape-context forest cover gradient (6%-60%). 3. Land use type was a key factor influencing avian cross-habitat spillover, facilitating species movement into coffee plantations and acting as a barrier to spillover into cattle pastures. We found that 24% of the forest-dependent species pool was capable of spillover into coffee plantations, while spillover was nearly non-existent in cattle pastures. 4. Forest cover was also the main driver of spillover into coffee plantations. There was a positive relationship between forest cover and spillover, potentially due to processes related with (1) a higher density of organism in-patches, (2) decreased isolation among patches facilitating species movement and (3) higher landscape supplementation processes. 5. Finally, we found edge density had an additive effect with forest cover on spillover. Spillover was higher in high-forested landscapes with many forest-matrix edges, possibly due to increased structural connectivity for species able to move through edges, and to improved access for forest-dwelling species to different resource types (complementation processes). 6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that land use type is a key factor facilitating species spillover into agricultural matrices and that the influence of land use type on spillover is further modulated by a combination of native habitat amount and edge density. These results should be considered in efforts to design or manage sustainable agricultural landscapes in order to enhance both bird persistence and the provision of bird-mediated ecosystem services.","MAY",2018

The model is calibrated to real data on the farms and the landscape to be studied. We illustrate the utility of the model by evaluating the potential impacts of three alternative frameworks for the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on landscape values in two marginal agricultural regions. Mosaic value was found to be sensitive to the choice of policy scheme in one of the landscapes, whereas significant trade-offs were shown to occur in terms of species richness by habitat and species composition at the landscape scale in both regions. The relationship between food production and other ecosystem services was found to be multifaceted. Thus illustrating the difficulty of achieving landscape goals in a particular region with simple or general land management rules (such as the current rules attached to CAPs direct payments).

We adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework in the GBR's Tully-Murray catchment to identify trade-offs between linked ecosystem services and stakeholders. Applying four land use scenarios we assessed outcomes for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation, and trade-offs with six floodplain services and four GBR services. Based on statistical correlations between ecosystem services' status under the scenarios, we identified trade-offs and thresholds between services and associated stakeholders. The most direct trade-off in floodplain services (and primary stakeholders) was food and fibre production (farmers) versus water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen). There were synergies between water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen) and floodplain recreational and commercial fisheries (fishermen). Scale mis-matches between water quality management structures and ecosystem service flows were also evident.

The investigation of consistent associations between ecological parameters, called bundles, and of their links to landscape composition and structure is essential to inform management and policy, yet it is still in its infancy. We mapped over the French Alps an unprecedented array of 18 ecological parameters (16 ES and two biodiversity parameters) and explored their co-occurrence patterns underpinning the supply of multiple ecosystem services in landscapes. We followed a three-step analytical framework to i) detect the ES and biodiversity associations relevant at regional scale, ii) identify the clusters supplying consistent bundles of ES at subregional scale and iii) explore the links between landscape heterogeneity and ecological parameter associations at landscape scale. We used successive correlation coefficients, overlap values and self-organizing maps to characterize ecological bundles specific to given land cover types and geographical areas of varying biophysical characteristics and human uses at nested scales from regional to local. The joint analysis of land cover richness and ES gamma diversity demonstrated that local landscape heterogeneity alone did not imply compatibility across multiple ecosystem services, as some homogeneous landscape could supply multiple ecosystem services.Synthesis and applications. Bundles of ecosystem services and biodiversity parameters are shaped by the joint effects of biophysical characteristics and of human history. Due to spatial congruence and to underlying functional interdependencies, ecological parameters should be managed as bundles even when management targets specific objectives. Moreover, depending on the abiotic context, the supply of multiple ecosystem services can arise either from deliberate management in homogeneous landscapes or from spatial heterogeneity.

Although studies linking ecosystem services and human well-being have provided theoretical insights into social and ecological trade-offs, we argue that ecosystem services research has paid insufficient attention to ""social feedbacks,"" people's cognitive and behavioral responses to change. We demonstrate that augmenting ecosystem services research with environmental justice approaches (exploring perceptions of the distribution of costs and benefits, decision making procedures, and recognition of different values and identities) can more effectively capture important responses to ecosystem governance. Spatial analysis of land use change, mixed-method assessment of multidimensional well-being, and qualitative environmental justice research were applied in three villages adjacent to Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northern Laos. Spatial analysis showed that, from 2006 to 2015, forest clearance for cultivation remained stable within the protected area. Well-being assessment revealed the local population benefited from rapidly increasing incomes, asset ownership, and reduced poverty during that time. In combination, spatial and well-being analyses paint a picture of limited trade-offs, despite growing incentives to exploit protected land and resources through cash crops and high-value forest products. In contrast, results from environmental justice research revealed profound trade-offs between conservation and local practices, and highlight governance deficiencies relating to procedure and recognition. Consequently, formal protected area rules were perceived to be illegitimate by many and actively undermined, for example through negotiated access with alternative authorities. We conclude that although well-being research provides an essential foundation to understand diverse attachments to natural resources, the addition of environmental justice research can reveal local perceptions and social feedbacks critical to ecosystem service trade-offs, and highlight pathways to reconcile them through satisfying stakeholders' diverse, dynamic objectives.",NA,2017

In this study, we investigated the diversity and patterns of wild landscapes in relation to ecological factors, human disturbances and land protection regime in the Mo river basin (Central Togo). First, we used geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify and spatially explicit the major land cover types occurring in the area. We performed a supervised classification of Landsat 8 image from 2014. Next, we used vegetation ordination and classification methods to detect vegetation group types and their similarity level from forest inventory data collected at 75 sites. Data from soil samples at the 75 sites and DEM-based topographical indices were used as biophysical variables to analyze factors of current landscape structure. Both satellite image classification and the outputs from ordination methods indicated that three major vegetation types (forestlands, woodlands and savannahs/shrubs) occurred in protected (PA) and unprotected (UPA) areas. Image classification showed that savannahs/shrubs are the most widespread vegetation types (54.4%) while forestlands and woodlands cover 10.4% and 26.4% of the total area, respectively. UPA showed high rates of human disturbances that shaped the occurrence of a fourth vegetation type made up mainly by degraded savannahs and woodlands. Along the land protection gradient, the landscapes are driven by soil nutrients and moisture, in combination with the influence of topography and human disturbances. In both PA and UPA, and along protection gradient, majority of features exhibited significant differences among plant communities. The spatial analyses combined with the field data providing information on vegetation cover, species richness, and human footprint indices suggested that some areas outside protection still exhibit high potentials for land conservation. In multifunctional landscapes of Mo basin, conservation strategies could also be encouraged in the wild landscapes of community common lands to promote both biodiversity conservation and sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

Removing the desirable components of biodiversity is at odds with the philosophy of ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation more generally. Moreover, commonly used metrics generated by such survey approaches (e. g. abundance and species richness) are only indirectly related to the ecosystem services (e. g. pollination) that are often of primary interest. We examined the relationship between rates of dung removal (a direct measure of an ecosystem service) and dung beetle abundance and species richness in a temperate region of New South Wales, Australia, and examined if dung removal in revegetated riparian areas of different ages were trending monotonically toward rates in areas with mature native vegetation. Pellets of pig manure and conventional traps were left at study sites for 48 h to examine the relationships between rates of dung removal and dung beetle abundance and richness. Regressions of abundance and richness with average percent dung removal were positive and significant, demonstrating the potential of the method as a non-lethal proxy. While the dung removal method cannot determine the species responsible, percentage dung removal was more time-efficient, costing 4 min per sample, while abundance and richness cost 13 and 17 min, respectively. Despite variability among replicates of the same habitat type, the trajectory across the restoration gradient showed an increase from sites recently revegetated toward those with mature woody vegetation. We interpreted these results as a positive response of dung beetle activity and an indication of recovery of this ecosystem service. We argue that responses that can be collected efficiently such as dung removal should be used if restorationists have limited resources for data collection and analysis; non-specialists are involved; knowledge of ecosystem function is required, and animal ethics constrain options.

However, the contribution of wild bees remains unmeasured for many crops, and the effects of anthropogenic change on many bee species are unstudied. We experimentally investigated how pollination by wild bees affects tomato production in northern California. We found that wild bees substantially increase the production of field-grown tomato, a crop generally considered self-pollinating. Surveys of the bee community on 14 organic fields that varied in proximity to natural habitat showed that the primary bee visitors, Anthophora urbana Cresson and Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, were affected differently by land management practices. B. vosnesenskii was found primarily on farms proximate to natural habitats, but neither proximity to natural habitat nor tomato floral abundance, temperature, or year explained variation in the visitation rates of A. urbana. Natural habitat appears to increase B. vosnesenskii populations and should be preserved near farms. Additional research is needed to determine how to maintain A. urbana. Species-specific differences in dependency on natural habitats underscore the importance of considering the natural histories of individual bee species when projecting population trends of pollinators and designing management plans for pollination services. Thus, to maintain an entire bee community, multiple approaches, including maintaining natural habitat, should be implemented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","NOV",2006

The following five ecosystem services, which are of special importance for urban areas, were selected: local climate regulation, recreation potential, biodiversity potential, food supply, and above-ground carbon storage. These services were analyzed from 1990 to 2006. Our results identified only slight increases in urbanization (1% or 3 km(2)) and in mining restoration (-11 km(2)). However, the detected land use changes led to synergies with biodiversity and climate regulation of > 50% of the total area, whereas trade-offs of approximately 60% were detected between variables such as climate regulation and recreation.

Charles","BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY","Disruption to the physical structure of plant communities by habitat fragmentation can change microclimates, so leaf litter decomposition rates, being dependent on temperature and moisture, may also be affected. Similarly, smaller-scale structural features of plant communities can modify microclimates, and so may produce distinctive spatial patterns in decomposition rates. We investigated the effects of three types of structural feature having the potential to alter litter layer microclimates: fragmentation-induced modification that diminishes with distance from remnant edges (edge-core); concentric zones of locally modified conditions imposed by individual trees (Belsky-Canham); and highly localised abiotic modification collectively imposed by herbaceous plants (ground cover). We conducted a litter bag experiment in woodland remnants, testing whether the observed spatial variability in litter decomposition was attributable to one or more of these three structural features. The data provided the strongest support for the Belsky-Canham hypothesis, and the least support for the ground cover hypothesis. However, the hypotheses were not mutually exclusive, for each explained a component of the observed variability not explained by either of the other two. Proximity to remnant edge, proximity to trees, canopy light penetration, and ground cover density each explained part of the observed variability between plots. Decomposition rates did not differ with remnant area per se, for the effects of fragmentation were weak, and differed with cardinal direction. In contrast, the effects of individual trees were much stronger, and accounted for most of the between-plot variability. We found that litter decomposition rates in small remnants are only weakly affected by fragmentation, and we consider that the contributions of small remnants to landscape-scale functioning warrant closer attention.","JUN",2013

P.","ANIMAL CONSERVATION","Ecosystem engineers directly or indirectly affect the availability of resources through changing the physical state of biotic and/or abiotic materials. Fossorial ecosystem engineers have been hypothesized as affecting fire behaviour through altering litter accumulation and breakdown, however, little evidence of this has been shown to date. Fire is one of the major ecological processes affecting biodiversity globally. Australia has seen the extinction of 29 of 315 terrestrial mammal species in the last 200 years and several of these species were ecosystem engineers whose fossorial actions may increase the rate of leaf litter breakdown. Thus, their extinction may have altered the rate of litter accumulation and therefore fire ignition potential and rate of spread. We tested whether a reduction in leaf litter was associated with sites where mammalian ecosystem engineers had been reintroduced using a pair-wise, cross-fence comparison at sites spanning the Australian continent. At Scotia (New South Wales), Karakamia (Western Australia) and Yookamurra (South Australia) sanctuaries, leaf litter mass (-24%) and percentage cover of leaf litter (-3%) were significantly lower where reintroduced ecosystem engineers occurred compared to where they were absent, and fire behaviour modelling illustrated this has substantial impacts on flame height and rate of spread. This result has major implications for fire behaviour and management globally wherever ecosystem engineers are now absent as the reduced leaf litter volumes where they occur will lead to decreased flame height and rate of fire spread. This illustrates the need to restore the full suite of biodiversity globally.","DEC",2016

At a broad scale, we assessed the ecological niche and habitat suitability for both species using the Species Distribution Modeling method based on the recent ensembles of small models (ESM) approach. At a fine scale, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) was applied to assess habitat selection by each species. Direct observation was used at each roost to estimate the total number of individuals and to identify the roost characteristics. At both broad and fine scales, the analyses highlighted clear niche partitioning by the two species. We found that P. livingstonii has a very limited distribution, restricted to steep, high-elevation slopes of the islands' remaining natural forests, and the patterns were the same for roosting, foraging sites and the entire habitat. By contrast, P. s. comorensis has a relatively large geographic range that extends over low-elevation farmlands and villages and it was negatively correlated to natural forest across the entire area and all roosting sites, but its foraging areas were positively correlated to natural forest and high elevation areas. Both species selected large, tall trees for roosting. The total number of individuals in the studied area was estimated to be 1243 P. livingstonii and 11,898 P. s. comorensis. The results of our study demonstrated that these two species use different habitat types and ensure different ecosystem services in pollination and seed dispersion and thus are both critical for maintaining overall ecosystem dynamics. However, the currently high level of hunting pressure and roost disturbance makes them vulnerable to extinction. To ensure the viability of both species, conservation measures need to be taken by the Comoros government.","JUL",2018

Teleost fish excrete precipitated carbonate and make significant contributions to the marine inorganic carbon cycle at regional and global scales. As total carbonate production is linked to fish size and abundance, fishing is predicted to affect carbonate production by modifying fish abundance and size-structure. 2. We draw on concepts from physiology, metabolic ecology, life history theory, population dynamics and community ecology to develop, validate and apply analytical tools to assess fishing impacts on carbonate production. Outputs suggest that population and community carbonate production fall rapidly at lower rates of fishing than those used as management targets for sustainable yield. 3. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by estimated trends in carbonate production by a herring population and a coral reef fish community subject to fishing. Our analytical results build on widely applicable relationships between life history parameters and metabolic rates, and can be generalized to most fished ecosystems. 4. Synthesis and applications. If the maintenance of chemical processes as well as biological process were adopted as a management objective for fisheries then the methods we have developed can be applied to assess the effects of fishing on carbonate production and to advise on acceptable rates of fishing. Maintenance of this ecosystem service would require lower rates of fishing mortality than those recommended to achieve sustainable yield.","OCT",2009

Restoration efforts could be improved if we knew how site characteristics at landscape scales affect the ecological success of these foundation species. In this study, we determined how salt marsh shoreline geomorphologies (e.g. with variable hydrodynamic energy, fetch, erosion rates, and slopes) affect the success of restored intertidal oyster reefs, as well as how fauna utilize restored reefs and forage along marsh habitats. We constructed oyster reefs along three marsh shoreline geomorphologies in May 2012: 1) ""creek"" (small-fetch, gradual-sloped shoreline), ""ramp"" (large-fetch, gradual-sloped shoreline), and ""scarp"" (large-fetch, steep-sloped shoreline). Following recruitment, oyster spat density was greatest on ramp reefs; however, 2 years later, the highest adult oyster densities were found on creek reefs. Total nekton and blue crab catch rates in trawl nets were highest in the creek, while piscivore catch rates in gill nets were highest along the scarp shoreline. We found no difference in predation on snails in the salt marsh behind constructed reef and nonconstructed reference sites, but there were more snails consumed in the creek shoreline, which corresponded with the distribution of their major predator-blue crabs. We conclude that oyster reef construction was most successful for oysters in small-fetch, gradual-sloped, creek environments. However, nekton abundance did not always follow the same trends as oyster density, which could suggest constructed reefs may offer similar habitat-related functions (prey availability and refuge) already present along existing salt marsh borders.","NOV",2019

Understanding where marine communities are declining provides an indication of ecosystems of concern and highlights potential conflicts between seafood provisioning from wild fisheries and other ecosystem services. Here we use the nonparametric statistic, Kendall's tau, to assess trends in biomass of exploited marine species across a range of ecosystems. The proportion of 'Non-Declining Exploited Species' (NDES) is compared among ecosystems and to three community-level indicators that provide a gauge of the ability of a marine ecosystem to function both in provisioning and as a regulating service: survey-based mean trophic level, proportion of predatory fish, and mean life span. In some ecosystems, NDES corresponds to states and temporal trajectories of the community indicators, indicating deteriorating conditions in both the exploited community and in the overall community. However differences illustrate the necessity of using multiple ecological indicators to reflect the state of the ecosystem. For each ecosystem, we discuss patterns in NDES with respect to the community-level indicators and present results in the context of ecosystem-specific drivers.

Developing these frameworks requires a systematic approach to trait selection and addressing the interrelationships among the scale of the environmental change, area of ecosystem service provision and the most appropriate traits for analysis. 3. We examine key issues in the application of trait approaches to vertebrates, drawing specifically on the substantial progress made in this area for plants. We argue that vertebrate ecologists need to develop more coherent and systematic trait-based approaches that are broadly applicable. 4. We present a new framework for selecting response and effect traits to link environmental change with ecosystem services. An empirical example of each step in the framework is provided using birds as a case study, linking the environmental change of loss of tree cover with the ecosystem service of invertebrate pest regulation in apple orchards. We found that as tree cover around orchards increased so did the abundance and foraging rate of bird species that pursue invertebrates in flight, and this may help reduce the abundance of certain pests of apples (e.g. adult stages of Cydia pomonella and Helicoverpa armigera). 5.

Since 2002, 1214 permanent and semi-permanent plots within the PEBANPA Network have enabled researchers to monitor and assess functions and trends among vegetation parameters, biodiversity, forest dynamics, soil physicochemical characteristics, and land use management. The objectives of this manuscript are to communicate the role and rationale of the PEBANPA Network, summarize examples of the main results found within the network and provide guidance to decision makers with respect to advancing sustainable land management in southern Patagonia. As examples, rangeland health indices, seedling and sapling regeneration under different timber managed forests, litterfall and seeds production under silvopastoral use, and soil carbon content impacted by livestock grazing have all been assessed. Vegetation and environmental variables including soil respiration, soil water infiltration, soil water retention capacity, soil erosion, and litter cover were measured under different grazing intensities. Livestock and forestry production have caused changes in the original floristic patterns, with several areas experiencing desertification. Heavy stocking rates have caused the greatest impacts on grassland soil carbon (C) loss as a consequence of soil erosion. We were able to conclude that low medium grazing intensities yield the most positive impacts for biodiversity and soil physicochemical characteristics. Studies regarding levels of seedling and sapling regeneration post-harvest of timber further supported the importance of long-term monitoring due to the strongest evidence of interactions occurring 20 to 30 years after harvest. Distribution patterns of vascular plants and epigaeic coleopterons diversity revealed statistically significant differences among geographical zones and dominant vegetation types. The PEBANPA Network helps southern Patagonia address the challenges of unsustainable land management and climate change through monitoring ecosystem function and services. Long-term monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem function help decision makers better understand the impacts of land use practices, develop well-informed policies and secure present and future human well-being.

Research has centered on regulation services with little research in support services such as nursery habitat and provisioning of non-timber forest products (NTFP). We evaluate structural characteristics of 210 trees of ten species of ecological importance from a Colombian oak forest and their relation to Philodendron longirrhizum (Araceae) and its production of aerial roots to obtain fibers. This species was present in the majority of forest tree species, the structural characteristics of the trees were not distinguished between hosts and non-hosts and the rugosity of the bark and diameter of the trunk of the host species influenced the number of total and harvestable roots. The nursery habitat offered by the oak forest results from the mechanism that P. longirrhizum uses to climb over a wide variety of hosts, and the provisioning service is fostered by larger host trees that favor the production of roots. For the management of P. longirrhizum we suggest the establishment of individuals over the majority of trees if the aim is the enrichment and the establishment of individuals on larger trees if the aim is to increase the production of fiber.

Biocrusts can be classified into cyanobacteria-, lichen-, and bryophytedominated types, which reflect stages of ecological succession. In this study, we examined whether these categories include a shift in heterotrophic communities and whether this may be linked to altered physiological properties. We analyzed the microbial community composition by means of qPCR and high-throughput amplicon sequencing and utilized flux measurements to investigate their physiological properties. Our results revealed that once 16S and 18S rRNA gene copy numbers increase, fungi become more predominant and alpha diversity increases with progressing succession. Bacterial communities differed significantly between biocrust types with a shift from more generalized to specialized organisms along succession. CO2 gas exchange measurements revealed large respiration rates of late successional crusts being significantly higher than those of initial biocrusts, and different successional stages showed distinct NO and HONO emission patterns. Thus, our study suggests that the photoautotrophic organisms facilitate specific microbial communities, which themselves strongly influence the overall physiological properties of biocrusts and hence local to global nutrient cycles.","APR",2018

Despite limited research, and evidence of deleterious effects to biodiversity, international organisations have earmarked this system for cropland. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are sensitive indicators of habitat fragmentation, and contribute to ecosystem services at a range of scales. We investigated how rangelands, villages and croplands differ in ant species and functional diversity, and assemblage composition. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 42 sites (14 replicates each in rangeland, cropland, and village) in northern South African savannas. We investigated the impact of landuse, season, and multiple soil and vegetation habitat variables on ant species diversity, assemblages and functional diversity. Rangelands had the greatest ant species richness, particularly in the wet season. Richness declined with increasing soil clay content. Ant assemblages were distinctly different between landuse types. Rangeland harboured the widest diversity of indicator species, and contained greatest functional diversity. Rangelands accommodated more scavengers, granivores, and plant-matter feeders than cropland, and representation of these groups varied with season. Ants play essential roles in soil nutrient cycling, plant and seedling recruitment, and impact other arthropods through predation and aphidoculous behaviour that in turn influences entire food webs. Thus, the reduced species richness, changes in assemblage composition and the loss of functional groups in ant assemblages found in cropland and villages is potentially problematic. Left unchallenged, these new forms of landuse threaten to characterise the entire African savanna system, impacting not only future ecological, but possibly also human wellbeing.","MAR",2018

Landscape management practices that alter energetic linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats can affect associated ecosystem processes, and ultimately the provision of ecosystem services of importance to humanity. Such effects cannot always be inferred from current biomonitoring schemes, which are typically based on assessment of community structural parameters rather than functional attributes related to important ecosystem-level processes. 2. We investigated effects of forest clearcutting, a major landscape-level disturbance known to alter the energetic basis of aquatic food webs, on headwater streams in northern Sweden. The key ecosystem process of leaf decomposition was measured as an index of ecosystem functioning. The biomass of detritivorous shredders was also quantified, along with various community structural parameters associated with the diversity, composition and functional guild organisation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. 3. No differences in macroinvertebrate abundance, diversity or assemblage composition were detected between forested and clearcut streams, and most functional guilds were similarly unaffected, though species density of scrapers was higher in forested than clearcut channels. 4. In contrast, mass loss of two leaf species was elevated in all clearcut streams, with evidence for increases in the efficiency per degree-day of both the microbial and detritivore mediated fractions of decomposition. 5. Increased rates of leaf mass loss in the clearcut streams were associated with greater phosphate concentrations and shredder biomass, and with an increased relative abundance of broadleaves in standing stocks of benthic litter. Together, these findings indicate a more rapid transfer of energy and nutrients through the detrital pathways of our clearcut streams. 6. These results demonstrate the utility of litter decomposition assays for monitoring effects of forest management on stream ecosystem functioning, and have implications for nutrient cycles in landscapes extensively influenced by forest management. The markedly different responses of our functional and structural measures to clearcutting highlight the value of incorporating methods for the functional assessment of ecosystems into biomonitoring schemes.","OCT",2009

Respondents were randomly assigned to see images of one of three types of nearby neighbors' yards: all conventional, all ecologically innovative, or a mix. They rated front yard design alternatives in one of these three neighborhood contexts. Both broad cultural norms for conventional front yards and neighborhood norms significantly affected homeowners' preference for their own yards. However, neighborhood norms most dramatically affected preference: the rank of the most conventional and most ecologically beneficial front yard designs was reversed depending upon the design of nearby neigh bors' yards. We conclude that efforts to introduce ecologically innovative designs to metropolitan residential landscapes should approach change at the neighborhood scale in order to enhance initial success and long term cultural sustainability. We also note that individuals who innovate on their own properties may want to enlist nearby neighbors in similar innovations to create a threshold of cultural sustainability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We first identify four fundamental principles of FLR, based on previous definitions. We then critically evaluate the application of these principles in practice, based on the experience gained during an international, collaborative research project conducted in six dry forest landscapes of Latin America. Research highlighted the potential for FLR; tree species of high socioeconomic value were identified in all study areas, and strong dependence of local communities on forest resources was widely encountered, particularly for fuelwood. We demonstrated that FLR can be achieved through both passive and active restoration approaches, and can be cost-effective if the increased provision of ecosystem services is taken into account. These results therefore highlight the potential for FLR, and the positive contribution that it could make to sustainable development. However, we also encountered a number of challenges to FLR implementation, including the difficulty of achieving strong engagement in FLR activities among local stakeholders, lack of capacity for community-led initiatives, and the lack of an appropriate institutional and regulatory environment to support restoration activities. Successful implementation of FLR will require new collaborative alliances among stakeholders, empowerment and capacity building of local communities to enable them to fully engage with restoration activities, and an enabling public policy context to enable local people to be active participants in the decision making process.",NA,2012

However, little information exists on how restoration combined with climate change might influence hydrology across large forest landscapes that incorporate multiple vegetation types and complex fire regimes. We combined spatially explicit vegetation and fire modeling with statistical water and sediment yield models for a large forested landscape (335,000 ha) on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, USA. Our objective was to assess the impacts of climate change and forest restoration on the future fire regime, forest vegetation, and watershed outputs. Our model results predict that the combination of climate change and high-severity fire will drive forest turnover, biomass declines, and compositional change in future forests. Restoration treatments may reduce the area burned in high-severity fires and reduce conversions from forested to non-forested conditions. Even though mid-elevation forests are the targets of restoration, the treatments are expected to delay the decline of high-elevation spruce-fir, aspen, and mixed conifer forests by reducing the occurrence of high-severity fires that may spread across ecoregions. We estimate that climate-induced vegetation changes will result in annual runoff declines of up to 10%, while restoration reduced or reversed this decline. The hydrologic model suggests that mid-elevation forests, which are the targets of restoration treatments, provide around 80% of runoff in this system and the conservation of mid- to high-elevation forests types provides the greatest benefit in terms of water conservation. We also predict that restoration treatments will conserve water quality by reducing patches of high-severity fire that are associated with high sediment yield. Restoration treatments are a management strategy that may reduce undesirable outcomes for multiple ecosystem services.","SEP",2018

To enhance these services, cities are investing in programs to create urban forests. A major unknown, however, is whether planted trees will grow into the mature, closed-canopied forest on which ecosystem service provision depends. We assessed the influence of biotic and abiotic land management on planted tree performance as part of urban forest restoration in New York City, U.S.A. Biotic treatments were designed to improve tree growth, with the expectation that higher tree species composition (six vs. two) and greater stand complexity (with shrubs vs. without) would facilitate tree performance. Similarly, the abiotic treatment (compost amendment vs. without) was expected to increase tree performance by improving soil conditions. Growth and survival was measured for approximately 1,300 native saplings across three growing seasons. The biotic and abiotic treatments significantly improved tree performance, where shrub presence increased tree height for five of the six tree species, and compost increased basal area and stem volume of all species. Species-specific responses, however, highlighted the difficulty of achieving rapid growth with limited mortality. Pioneer species had the highest growth in stem volume over 3 years (up to 3,500%), but also the highest mortality (up to 40%). Mid-successional species had lower mortality (<16%), but also the slowest growth in volume (approximately 500% in volume). Our results suggest that there will be trade-offs between optimizing tree growth versus survival when implementing urban tree planting initiatives.","SEP",2015

Alternatively, protecting crops against pests can be achieved through the reinforcement of regulation ecological services. Our work propounds a data-driven methodological framework to derive relevant agricultural landscape rearrangements enhancing populations of beneficial organisms regulating pests. Building on spatialised entomological and geographic data, we developed a parsimonious reaction diffusion model describing the population dynamics of beneficial organisms. Parameter estimation was carried out in a Bayesian framework accounting for uncertainty in the measurement. Thousands of agricultural landscapes were generated under agronomic specifications dealt with as constraint satisfaction problems. Population dynamics was simulated on each landscape with the fitted reaction-diffusion model mentioned above, and two metrics of abundances allowed the assessment of the regulation performance of the landscape spatial arrangements. One metric is a mean field performance criterion assessing the regulation performance from the landscape composition only, the other is a spatial performance metric assessing the performance resulting from the whole landscape spatial configuration. The former is computed with a non-spatialised form of the population dynamics model, the latter results from the reaction-diffusion model of the population dynamics. Comparing these metrics enabled to quantify the impact of spatial arrangements, hence allowing arrangements proposals. This framework was applied to the case study of a ground beetle species involved in the biological regulation of weeds. The arrangement proposals abides by the productive agronomic constraint that is the landscape composition, while they allow for significant habitat quality enhancement (or deterioration) for the beneficial organism (or a pest). Minor adaptations of our integrated data-driven approach would suit numerous situations ranging from the provision of enhanced ecosystem services to land management for conservation.

Nutrient loading often first affects the primary productivity of aquatic systems through shifts in phytoplankton communities. However, ecologically important changes in phytoplankton are often not relatable to the general public-whose behavior would need to change to alter patterns of nutrient loading. Therefore, we use the STressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services Framework to develop 154 chains that link changes in biological indicators of aquatic eutrophication (a shift in phytoplankton community) to final ecosystem services that people use or appreciate. We identify 13 ecological production functions (EPF) within three different ecosystems (alpine lakes, lakes, and estuaries) that connect changes in phytoplankton and algae to ecological endpoints that the general public and policy makers can appreciate. Using the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System, we identify 18 classes of human beneficiaries that potentially will be impacted by a change in one of these endpoints. We further assign strength-of-science scores to each link within the EPFs for the 154 chains according to how well each link is supported by current peer-reviewed literature. By identifying many pathways through which excess N loading in U. S. surface waters can affect ecosystems and ultimately the beneficiaries of ecosystem services, this work intends to draw attention to gaps in empirical ecological literature that constrain understanding of the magnitude of effects that excess N loading can have on human well-being. Results highlight the importance of intersections between the natural and social sciences when managers and policy makers evaluate impacts from ecological stressors.

Yet for most taxa, such patterns are rarely examined, especially at different levels of ecological organization (e.g., species-vs. community-level patterns). We compiled data on biomass, production, and P/B rates of freshwater fish communities and species across latitudes and contrast patterns observed at the community level with those observed for species. At the community level, and at two distinct spatial scales (global vs. continental-North American), negative or neutral relationships were apparent between biomass, production, and P/B with latitude; however, there was substantial scatter in these data. Yet at the species level in North America, production was often closely linked to latitude, but in the opposite direction: Many species showed improved production with latitude. Latitudinal increases in species-level production rates were strongest for cool-and cold-water species, and species rarely showed the opposite trend. Species-level increases in production with latitude strengthened when production rates were normalized by the thermal opportunity for production, suggesting potential adaptations of individuals and populations to shorter growing seasons (i.e., ""countergradient"" production) at high latitudes. At the global scale, there were apparent unimodal relationships between community fish production measures and species richness; however, these patterns became linearized or non-significant at the continental scale. Decreased interspecific competition at northern latitudes combined with genetic adaptations (e.g., countergradient growth) could explain a tendency for increased species production in northern populations, while total community production remains reduced. Latitude has contrasting effects on fish production at different spatial scales and levels of biological organization. Thus while freshwater fish communities are somewhat more productive and diverse at lower latitudes, species production in northern populations is often surprisingly high.","JAN",2017

Climate change could increase the rate of shrub encroachment, amplify precipitation variability, and thus alter bottom-up processes for animal communities. Desert rodents are important biodiversity elements of arid grasslands and shrublands that exert strong effects on soil, vegetation, and other animal species. We used long-term data from the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico to ask whether bottom-up control of desert rodents changes across shrub encroachment gradients. Our design included spatial blocks with replicated ecological states representing transitions from black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) to honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Grassland-to-shrubland transitions did not produce degraded ecosystems, on average, with reduced net primary production or decreased rodent biomass. However, more rodent biomass was supported on unencroached grasslands following droughts whose frequency and severity may increase in southwestern United States. Hence, the observed evenness in rodent biomass across ecological states should be sensitive to climate change. The best predictors of rodent biomass also differed markedly for two trophic groups. This outcome was explained by considering core-transient dynamics. Granivores were mostly core species that regularly occurred on sites and responded to lagged net primary production at local scales, whereas folivores included transient species (especially Sigmodon hispidus) that responded to lagged precipitation at broader scales via spillover dynamics. Bottom-up processes for desert rodents across shrub invasion gradients were understood by integrating lagged responses to productivity pulses with core-transient structuring of communities.","JUL",2018

This is particularly true when the scale of the disturbance no longer matches the regeneration strategy of the dominant vegetation. In the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of California, over a century of fire exclusion and the warming climate are increasing the incidence and extent of stand-replacing wildfire; such changes in severity patterns are altering regeneration dynamics by dramatically increasing the distance from live tree seed sources. This has raised concerns about limitations to natural reforestation and the potential for conversion to non-forested vegetation types, which in turn has implications for shifts in many ecological processes and ecosystem services. We used a California region-wide data set with 1,848 plots across 24 wildfires in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests to build a spatially explicit habitat suitability model for forecasting postfire forest regeneration. To model the effect of seed availability, the critical initial biological filter for regeneration, we used a novel approach to predicting spatial patterns of seed availability by estimating annual seed production from existing basal area and burn severity maps. The probability of observing any conifer seedling in a 60-m(2) area (the field plot scale) was highly dependent on 30-yr average annual precipitation, burn severity, and seed availability. We then used this model to predict regeneration probabilities across the entire extent of a new fire (the 2014 King Fire), which highlights the spatial variability inherent in postfire regeneration patterns. Such forecasts of postfire regeneration patterns are of importance to land managers and conservationists interested in maintaining forest cover on the landscape. Our tool can also help anticipate shifts in ecosystem properties, supporting researchers interested in investigating questions surrounding alternative stable states, and the interaction of altered disturbance regimes and the changing climate.","SEP",2018

Philip","ECOSYSTEMS","Understanding the role of diversity in the functioning of ecosystems has important implications for agriculture. Previous agricultural research has shown that crop rotation and the use of cover crops can lead to increases in yield relative to monoculture; however, few studies have been performed within the broader context of diversity-ecosystem function theory and in the absence of chemical inputs. We performed a field experiment in SW Michigan, USA, in which we manipulated the number of crop species grown in rotation and as winter cover crops over a 3-year period to test if varying the number of species in a rotation affected grain yield, a critical metric of ecosystem function in row-crops. The experimental design was unique in that no fertilizer or pesticides were used, and the only management variable manipulated was number of species in the rotation, thus providing a strong comparison to grassland diversity-ecosystem function experiments. Treatments included continuous monocultures of three row-crops, corn Zea mays L., soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr., and winter wheat Triticum aestivum L., and 2- and 3-year annual rotations with and without cover crops (zero, one, or two legume/small grain species), encompassing a range of crop diversity from one to six species. Crop yields and weed biomass were measured annually for 3 years and plant available soil nitrogen was measured over the course of the growing season in the final year of the study. In all 3 years, corn grain yield increased linearly in response to the number of crops in the rotation. Corn yields in the highest diversity treatment (three crops, plus three cover crops) were over 100% higher than in continuous monoculture and were not significantly different from the county average for each of the 3 years despite the absence of chemical inputs. Corn yields in the diversity treatments were strongly correlated with the availability of inorganic soil nitrogen, which was likely influenced by the number of different legume species (crops and cover crops) present in the rotation. In soybean and winter wheat, yield differences among crop diversity treatments were also significant, but of lower magnitude (32 and 53%, respectively), and showed little direct relationship to the number of crop species grown in a rotation. Results demonstrate that agricultural research motivated by ecological theory can provide important insights into the functioning of agroecosystems and enhance our understating of the linkages between diversity and ecosystem function. Importantly, these results suggest that reduced chemical inputs do not necessarily result in yield penalties and provide support for incorporation of crop or species diversity when determining how ecosystem services can be included in food, fiber, and biofuel production.","APR",2008

As many assessment studies have already been criticized for using oversimplified indicators, too much pragmatism may foreclose credibility and acceptance of ES assessments. Therefore, a cascade ES modelling approach was developed that incorporated ecological processes, multiple off-site effects, feedbacks and trade-off mechanisms through shared variables.

This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover.

This is a challenging task because different indicators of water quality and yield are expected to vary in their responsiveness to large versus local-scale heterogeneity in land use and land cover (LUC). Here we rely on water quality data collected between 1977 and 2000 from dozens of gauge stations in Puerto Rico together with precipitation data and land cover maps to (1) quantify impacts of spatial heterogeneity in LUC on several water quality indicators; (2) determine the spatial scale at which this heterogeneity influences water quality; and (3) examine how antecedent precipitation modulates these impacts. Our models explained 30-58% of observed variance in water quality metrics. Temporal variation in antecedent precipitation and changes in LUC between measurements periods rather than spatial variation in LUC accounted for the majority of variation in water quality. Urbanization and pasture development generally degraded water quality while agriculture and secondary forest re-growth had mixed impacts. The spatial scale over which LUC influenced water quality differed across indicators. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) responded to LUC in large-scale watersheds, in-stream nitrogen concentrations to LUC in riparian buffers of large watersheds, and fecal matter content and instream phosphorus concentration to LUC at the sub-watershed scale. Stream discharge modulated impacts of LUC on water quality for most of the metrics.

Restoring coastal ecosystems and degraded soils of these islands is essential to provisioning of numerous ecosystem services for the native islanders and ecological functions and services of these hotspots of biodiversity. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the impact of bunding and broad bed and furrow (BBF) systems in restoring the productivity of tsunami inundated coastal areas of southern Andaman. Bunding of agricultural land leached out the salts by impounding of rainwater with significant reduction in electrical conductivity (ECe), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and exchangeable ions (e.g., Na+, Ca2+ + Mg2+, Cl- and SO42-). The BBF system installed in the low lying waterlogged areas improved the drainage of the beds, harvested rain water (4476 m(3) ha(-1)), prevented entry of tidal and runoff water into the furrow, and reduced the overall salinity. In addition, microbial biomass carbon was significantly improved (193-210 mg kg(-1) soil). Whereas the low lying areas were inundated during the 20 to 45th standard meteorological week by 25 to 85 cm of water, soils under BBF systems were adequately drained and had moisture content between field capacity and the saturation level. The depth of submergence (R-2 = 0.798) and soil salinity (R-2 = 0.787) were correlated with the rainfall amount. Consequently, the BBF systems enabled a higher cropping intensity (218%), increased fish production (2.32 Mg ha(-1)) and water productivity (47.36 Rs m(-3)) and enhanced employment generation (213 man days).

Therefore, this study sought to assess the major ecological states and identify the main ecosystem services (ESs), along with local people's perceptions of wetland management. Nine wetlands were selected from pristine/reference, agricultural and urban land uses of the Lake Tana area. Numerous ESs were identified, categorized into four main ecosystem services, analyzed using a conceptual model adopted for this purpose, and their ecological conditions were assessed using a range of methods. The results revealed that the provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban types, as compared to wetlands located in pristine areas. Although most of the local residents positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services, weak policy and decision support such as wetland use planning, investment interventions and communal land ownership, and poor development of diversified livelihood were found to pose major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources. The range of plant species diversity among the impaired wetlands was observed to be related to the degree of disturbance, with urban and agricultural wetlands being highly degraded as compared to pristine wetlands. Moreover, these impaired wetlands were found to be invaded by upland and exotic weeds, out-competing the socioeconomically and ecologically important native species. (C) 2018 The Author.

Notwithstanding its ecosystem services, UGS is commonly perceived as inadvertent habitats for urban mosquitoes. Moreover, the lack of ecological understanding of mosquitoes and their urban habitats renders vector control in green spaces without reliance on chemical and bio-pesticides especially challenging. This study envisages the application of a comparative analytical method for the evaluation and optimization of vector management in different urban spaces. The research examines the extent of male habitat preference as measured by population characteristics of urban adult mosquitoes on green roof and control sites. Adult mosquito traps were deployed on green roofs (GR), bare roofs (negative control, NC), and low-elevation gardens (positive control, PC). Distribution of male and female members of vector species were analyzed Urban adult male mosquitoes exhibited highly-selective habitat use of the studied urban spaces, in that they were clustered chiefly in PC. Their spatial distributions are consistently explained by site group even under the stringent measure of presence/absence. The sex ratios of GR and NC were highly skewed toward females, which lends further to the interpretation of strong male habitat preference for the studied PC gardens. Urban mosquitoes do not display similar degrees of affinity for different types of green infrastructure. The methodology used can help prioritize urban sites and optimize control strategies. The uses of amenable environmental features salient to mosquito survival in landscape design should be explored as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly vector management approach.","MAR",2018

Based on widely used biophysical models, including the GLOPEM-CEVSA model, the precipitation storage method, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) and Underground Productivity Model (UPM), this study integrated multi-source data to analyze dynamic changes of regulating services, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, sand fixation and soil retention, and the provisioning service of grassland yield. For the GWP area during 2000-2013, the ecosystem pattern remained relatively stable and multiple ecosystem services showed overall improvement but there were local deteriorations. For the 14 years net primary productivity (NPP) and grassland yield (GY) increased substantially. Water regulation in forest, grassland and wetland/water body ecosystems improved slightly. The soil conservation function of the entire ecosystem was slightly enhanced with soil retention showing an increasing spatial homogenization and wind erosion having a decreasing tendency. Ecological restoration and reconstruction efforts and climate change helped to improve ecosystem services. Increases in both temperature and precipitation and ecological rehabilitation had a positive effect on vegetation restoration related to a marked increase of vegetation coverage. Increase in annual precipitation increased rainfall related erosion but also assisted water regulation. Reduction in wind speed effectively lowered the occurrence of wind erosion. Vegetation restoration directly increased NPP and GY, and was conducive to water regulation and soil conservation. However, grassland degradation still continued in local areas. Ecological programs applied to the grasslands of China should be continued. Adopting adaptive management approaches that facilitate the synergy of multiple ecosystem services are required to maximize their benefit to the people of China.","JUN",2018

Animal-mediated pollination is an essential ecosystem function and service provided to mankind. However, little is known how pollinator diversity could affect pollination services. Using a substitutive design, we experimentally manipulated functional group (FG) and species richness of pollinator communities to investigate their consequences on the reproductive success of an obligate out-crossing model plant species, Raphanus sativus. Both fruit and seed set increased with pollinator FG richness. Furthermore, seed set increased with species richness in pollinator communities composed of a single FG. However, in multiple-FG communities, highest species richness resulted in slightly reduced pollination services compared with intermediate species richness. Our analysis indicates that the presence of social bees, which showed roughly four times higher visitation rates than solitary bees or hoverflies, was an important factor contributing to the positive pollinator diversity-pollination service relationship, in particular, for fruit set. Visitation rate at different daytimes, and less so among flower heights, varied among social bees, solitary bees and hoverflies, indicating a niche complementarity among these pollinator groups. Our study demonstrates enhanced pollination services of diverse pollinator communities at the plant population level and suggests that both the niche complementarity and the presence of specific taxa in a pollinator community drive this positive relationship.","43806",2012

Caribbean coral reefs support and protect millions of livelihoods, but recent anthropogenic change is shifting communities toward reefs dominated by stress-resistant coral species, which are often less architecturally complex. With the regionwide decline in reef fish abundance, it is becoming increasingly important to understand changes in coral reef community structure and function. We quantify the influence of coral composition, diversity, and morpho-functional traits on the architectural complexity of reefs across 91 sites at Cozumel, Mexico. Although reef architectural complexity increases with coral cover and species richness, it is highest on sites that are low in taxonomic evenness and dominated by morpho-functionally important, reef-building coral genera, particularly Montastraea. Sites with similar coral community composition also tend to occur on reefs with very similar architectural complexity, suggesting that reef structure tends to be determined by the same key species across sites. Our findings provide support for prioritizing and protecting particular reef types, especially those dominated by key reef-building corals, in order to enhance reef complexity.","SEP",2011

R.; Willmer, P. G.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Interaction networks are widely used as tools to understand plant pollinator communities, and to examine potential threats to plant diversity and food security if the ecosystem service provided by pollinating animals declines. However, most networks to date are based on recording visits to flowers, rather than recording dearly defined effective pollination events. Here we provide the first networks that explicitly incorporate measures of pollinator effectiveness (PE) from pollen deposition on stigmas per visit, and pollinator importance (PI) as the product of PE and visit frequency. These more informative networks, here produced for a low diversity heathland habitat, reveal that plant pollinator interactions are more specialized than shown in most previous studies. At the studied site, the spedalization index H-2' was lower for the visitation network than the PE network, which was in turn lower than H-2' for the PI network Our study shows that collecting PE data is feasible for community-level studies in low diversity communities and that including information about PE can change the structure of interaction networks. This could have important consequences for our understanding of threats to pollination systems.","43715",2015

To assess the dynamics and efficiency of bacterial degradation, reliable microbial simulation models, along with the relevant processes, are required. We present an approach aimed at improving reliability by studying the relevance and implications of an important concept from theoretical ecology in the context of a bacterial system: conditional dispersal denoting that the dispersal strategy depends on environmental conditions. Different dispersal strategies, which either incorporate or neglect this concept, are implemented in a bacterial model and results are compared to data obtained from laboratory experiments with Pseudomonas putida colonies growing on glucose agar. Our results show that, with respect to the condition of resource uptake, the model's correspondence to experimental data is significantly higher for conditional than for unconditional bacterial dispersal. In particular, these results support the hypothesis that bacteria disperse less when resources are abundant. We also show that the dispersal strategy has a considerable impact on model predictions for bacterial degradation of resources: disregarding conditional bacterial dispersal can lead to overestimations when assessing the performance of this ecosystem service.","FEB",2012

Estimating and managing these at a convenient scale requires information upscaling from the soil sample to the landscape level. We explore the feasibility of predicting nematode MFs from temperature-based bioclimatic parameters across a landscape. We assume that temperature effects are reflected in MFs, since temperature variations determine life processes ranging from enzyme activities to community structure. We use microclimate data recorded for 1 year from sites differing by orientation, altitude and vegetation cover. At the same sites we estimate MFs for each nematode trophic group. Our models show that bioclimatic parameters, specifically those accounting for temporal variations in temperature and extremities, predict most of the variation in nematode MFs. Higher fungivorous and lower bacterivorous nematode MFs are predicted for sites with high seasonality and low isothermality (sites of low vegetation, mostly at low altitudes), indicating differences in the relative contribution of the corresponding food web channels to the metabolism of carbon across the landscape. Higher plant-parasitic MFs were predicted for sites with high seasonality. The fitted models provide realistic predictions of unknown cases within the range of the predictor's values, allowing for the interpolation of MFs within the sampled region. We conclude that upscaling of the bioindication potential of nematode communities is feasible and can provide new perspectives not only in the field of soil ecology but other research areas as well.","SEP",2015

H.; Overton, Jacob McC.; Price, Robbie; Burrows, Lawrence E.; Allen, Robert B.","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","Increased afforestation of non-productive land could deliver win-win solutions for greenhouse gas mitigation through carbon sequestration and biodiversity gains, referred to here as increased 'ecological integrity'. We examined the potential trade-offs when selecting non-forested lands in New Zealand for natural forest regeneration to maximise gains in either, or both, carbon and biodiversity. We also examine the effect on potential gains and trade-offs of excluding non-conservation lands from spatial planning for conservation. The most significant per-hectare gains, for both carbon and biodiversity, were those occurring on non-conservation lands because conservation lands are mainly restricted to low-productivity environments where indigenous vegetation is already well represented. By contrast, productive environments, such as alluvial plains, where almost no indigenous vegetation remains, are primarily on non-conservation lands. These lands will need to be included in any reforestation strategy or else the most degraded ecosystems will not be restored. We found that biodiversity suffers a greater trade-off when carbon gain is prioritised than carbon does when biodiversity is prioritised. Trade-offs between carbon and biodiversity were higher on non-conservation lands but decreased with increasing area regenerated. Our study shows that natural regeneration will provide substantial increases in carbon and biodiversity on non-conservation lands compared with conservation lands. This emphasised the need for improved incentives to private land owners if carbon and biodiversity gain from afforestation is to be maximised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","JAN",2015

With the rise in demand for pollinator-dependent foods, such productivity losses may accelerate conversion of natural areas to cropland. Pollinationcompensation measures involving managed pollinators or hand pollination are not always optimal or are too costly. Introducing areas of native vegetation within cropland has been proposed as a way to supplement crop pollinators, but this measure is perceived by farmers to carry costs outweighing benefits to agricultural production. Studies quantifying benefits of small patches of native flowers to crop pollination are therefore necessary to encourage such practices. To ascertain whether provision of floral resources within farmlands can facilitate pollination, and hence, crop yields, small experimental patches of perennial native plants (native flower compensation areas, NFCAs) were created in nonproductive areas of large commercial fields of several cultivars of mango Mangifera indica. Pesticide use and isolation from natural habitat were associated with declines in flying visitors and in mango production (kg of marketable fresh fruit), but presence of NFCAs ameliorated these declines, and NFCAs did not harbour any mango pests. In areas far from natural vegetation, orchards near NFCAs had significantly higher diversity and abundance of mango flying visitors, as well as mango production, than orchards far from NFCAs, although these measures were still lower than in orchards close to natural areas. Neither the most abundant flower visitors to mango (ants) nor initial fruit set was significantly affected by distance, pesticides or NFCAs, suggesting that although fertilization is associated with factors unaffected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticide use (i.e. self- and ant-pollination), viable fruit set (and ultimately, production) requires cross-pollination, for which flying visitors are essential. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the presence of small patches of native flowers within large farms can increase pollinator-dependent crop production if combined with preservation of remaining fragments of natural habitat and judicious use of pesticides. Native flower compensation areas represent a profitable management measure for farmers, increasing cost-effectiveness of cropland while indirectly contributing to preservation of natural habitat.","DEC",2012

This site was created in 1971 as a place for research, teaching, and to conserve tropical dry forests in Mexico, and it has played a relevant role in the advancement of tropical science as well as in undergraduate and graduate education. For many years, researchers and students from Mexico and many other countries have used the facility that is part of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Here, we measured the extent to which social-ecological knowledge responds to information needs of rural people and found that very little of it has been shared with the local inhabitants. Local needs regarding pasture and forest management are covered by local people's own knowledge. In order to help bridging the gap between social-ecological knowledge and rural inhabitants, we describe and evaluate ongoing communication and educational projects. We propose a model that shows how knowledge generation, exchange, and use processes can be linked to facilitate the work of scientists and their institutions. Our aim is that the experience contributes to promote and strengthen linkage processes between scientists and rural people around the world in order to better transit toward sustainable social-ecological systems.","OCT",2018

This paper explores local cultural services in the Mai Pokhari, a Ramsar site of Nepal, and adopts a multi-scalar analysis to explore the implications of global policy making at the local scale. The research, informed by political ecology, applies mixed methods. At the local scale, spirituality, sense of place and traditional practices were identified as important local cultural values within ecosystem management. But such local values were found to be marginalized in conservation policy making at national and global levels. The Ramsar listing at the case study site resulted in restrictions on community activities and opened the possibility of resettlement, creating disenchantment among the local community whose access to cultural services was curtailed. The study emphasizes the need to recognise and value local cultural services in policy-making at all levels. This is important not only for refining and improving global conservation policy initiatives based on ecosystem services, but also for securing just and sustainable conservation and development goals.","OCT",2019

The influence of socioeconomics and location-specific factors on urban gardening patterns merits continued study. Using Beijing Municipal Province in China, a rapidly urbanizing region, as a case study, we address two questions: 1) How do biodiversity patterns change between different urbanized regions in Beijing? 2) How do ecosystem services provided by Beijing home gardens change with socioeconomic status and location-based preferences of gardeners? We surveyed 104 home gardens in Beijing Municipal Province for plant biodiversity, abundance, and species ecosystem services (ES) (provisioning or cultural uses). The gardens were distributed across three urbanized regions (suburban, peri-urban, and exurban). We found that species biodiversity and abundance shift according to a hierarchy of need from ornamentals (cultural ES) to edibles (provisioning ES) with increasing distance from Beijing. These trends are related to reduced income, lowered food security, and lack of urban markets in exurban regions. Rarefaction curves indicate ornamental species drive beta diversity. Ordination also showed a shift in species composition with increasing isolation from the city; Suburban and exurban gardens were the most different, while peri-urban gardens were similar to both others. Only exurban gardens had a positive relationship between species and area. High edible cover and high species density indicates that demand for edibles in exurban regions may be higher than space constraints allows. Our study better quantifies species biodiversity patterns in Beijing, and can inform urban planners about the value and usefulness of home garden space.","SEP",2014

Intentional planting of mosses on green roofs has shown that mosses can improve ecosystem services such as stormwater retention and microclimate cooling. Past studies of moss interactions with vascular plants on green roofs and in other habitats demonstrate both positive and negative effects on juvenile and adult tracheophytes. Moss can aid vascular plants by buffering environmental extremes, facilitating seed establishment, and improving nutrient and water availability. Conversely, moss can also hinder young seedling germination by blocking access to the soil column and/or light. In the green roof context, few studies have examined the relationship between moss and vascular plant germination. Since mosses commonly colonize green roofs it is important to understand the effects of established moss colonies on incoming plant propagules. The purpose of this study was to examine how four moss species, Atrichum undulatum (Hedw.) P. Beauv., Polytrichum commune Hedw., Polytrichum piliferum Hedw., and Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. affected the germination of weedy and native vascular plant seeds in a green roof system. Seeds were added to six pre-established moss treatments: monocultures of each moss species, a mixture which included all four moss species, and a substrate only control in pots on a rooftop. Overall, the control (moss-free) treatment resulted the highest germination rates for the majority of seeded species examined, an indication that for these vascular plants, mosses tend to inhibit germination of incoming seeds.","JUL",2018

In the case of wild rice, a cherished food resource of Northern Great Lakes landscapes, the dynamics involve (a) a changing distribution of wild rice lakes, (b) changing harvester population and demographics, and (c) different management overlays. Together these factors influence harvester choices and opportunities and create unexpected spatial dynamics between people and the lakes they harvest. In this paper we examine first, the regional distribution and characteristics of wild rice lakes through compilation of multi-agency data, geospatial analysis, license sales and harvest surveys. Second, we identify patterns of harvest in the region through six case study lakes and examine the decision-making models used to open lakes for harvest. Gathered together these various forms of knowledge and collected data sets inform our understanding of the social ecological systems involving wild rice (Zizania palustris). Watersheds with wild rice have declined by 32% since the early 1900s, and are now primarily limited to northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Across case studies wild rice harvesters tend to gather wild rice close to where they live or learned to harvest and 50% have more than 20 years experience. Some wild rice lakes draw harvesters from greater distances and in higher numbers. Models for managing the harvest of wild rice range from 'gather when ripe' by state entities to a more hands-on posting by reservation committees specifying hours and days of harvest on a lake by lake basis. The social ecological system around wild rice is a complex mosaic of multiple management jurisdictions, culturally diverse people, and an ecological system that is not well understood and potentially declining in extent. Defining the context of harvest within the spatially connected landscape and across multiple management systems is a first step in developing a shared framework of governance for the sustainability of wild rice landscapes.

Here, we model changes in urban land cover in Britain based on large (16%) projected increases in the human population by 2031, and the consequences for three different services-flood mitigation, agricultural production and carbon storage. We show that under a scenario of densification of urban areas, the combined effect of increasing population and loss of permeable surfaces is likely to result in 1.7 million people living within 1 km of rivers with at least 10 per cent increases in projected peak flows, but that increasing suburban 'sprawl' will have little effect on flood mitigation services. Conversely, losses of stored carbon and agricultural production are over three times as high under the sprawl as under the 'densification' urban growth scenarios.

However, little is known of how different attributes of species assemblages condition the quality of many services in real ecosystems affected by human impact. We explore the links between the attributes of a frugivore assemblage and the quantitative and qualitative components of its derived ecosystem service, seed dispersal, along a landscape-scale gradient of anthropogenic forest loss. Both the number and the richness of seeds being dispersed were positively related to frugivore abundance and richness. Seed dispersal quality, determined by the fine-scale spatial patterns of seed deposition, mostly depended on frugivore richness. In fact, richness was the only attribute of the frugivore assemblage affecting the probability of seed dispersal into deforested areas of the landscape. The positive relationships between frugivore richness per se (i.e. independent of frugivore abundance and composition) and all components of seed dispersal suggest the existence of functional complementarity and/or facilitation between frugivores. These links also point to the whole assemblage of frugivores as a conservation target, if we aim to preserve a complete seed dispersal service and, hence, the potential for vegetation regeneration and recovery, in human-impacted landscapes.","43684",2012

Shrinkage implies dramatic land-use impacts, including under-utilisation, vacancy, demolition, emerging brownfield sites, and de-densification. However, shrinkage also offers great potential to ""re-create"" that is, to enhance and implement urban green space including the ecosystem services it provides: Local climate and air quality regulation by trees that grow on abandoned land, carbon sequestration and storage by vegetation on vacant lots, preservation or enhancement of urban biodiversity, and recreational facilities that support the mental and physical health of the inhabitants through the enlargement of parks and woodlands. This paper argues that there is a linkage a nexus between shrinkage and ecosystem services provisioning. We develop a matrix approach that links the potentials of land use (change) related to urban shrinkage with ecosystem services provisioning in cities. Through a discussion of these potentials, challenges, and the relevant strategies of urban planning such as interim uses, urban afforestation, or community gardens, we show how planning policy in shrinking cities could benefit from considering the nexus between shrinkage and urban ecosystem services provision. Empirical evidence comes from Leipzig, Germany, a city that has, until very recently, experienced decades of shrinkage and still faces many of the resulting challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We illustrate this approach via a detailed case study in southern Transylvania, Romania, one of Europe's most significant biocultural refugia. Our goal was to understand current social-ecological dynamics and assess risks and opportunities for sustainable development. Our findings show that historical events have strongly shaped current conditions and current development trends in southern Transylvania.

This study related differences in three functional traits of pollinating bees ( flower height preference, daily time of flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the obligate cross-pollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir. across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r(2)=45%) than did species richness (r(2)=32%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.","43745",2008

The capacity of degraded grasslands to recover biomass is uncertain because legacies of degradation can strongly influence the demographic processes controlling ecosystem recovery. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding biomass carbon (C) flux in degraded perennial grassland based on demographic processes of growth, mortality and recruitment. We apply this framework to 22 years of data from Chionochloa- and Festuca-dominated perennial tussock grassland in the South Island high country, sampling two grazed sites and two sites retired from domestic grazing. Total biomass C stocks were assessed at site level using 174 temporary plots measured in 1989 and 2011. Long-term demographics were monitored using 24 permanent plots in which 7213 individual tussocks were tagged and monitored every 1-5 years from 1989 to 2011. Although biomass C stocks were generally low (2159 +/- 494 kg C ha(-1)), there was a significant increase in total biomass C over the 22-year period at the north-facing retired site of 92 +/- 47 kg C ha(-1) year(-1). Increases in total biomass C were generally due to recruitment and growth of tall tussock (Chionochloa spp.) and/or woody shrubs. Biomass C stock in grazed sites, and the retired south-facing site, declined by up to 65 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) or remained constant. Declines were due to dieback of the dominant short tussock (Festucanovae-zelandiae) across all treatments, and a lack of recruitment of tall tussock and shrub species. Our results suggest that retirement from grazing was not sufficient to ensure total biomass C gains after 22 years, and highlight the roles of recruitment limitation, shrub establishment and management history in controlling ecosystem recovery.",NA,2014

Each weed species was weighted based on the number of reported linkages with each animal group. Four biodiversity indices based on these weights were constructed and applied to exploring the ecological consequences of long-term changes in weed populations in Finland. Data were used from weed surveys of Finnish spring cereal fields conducted in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. The relative importance of weed species varied according to animal groups. Annual weed species able to produce numerous seeds were important for the farmland birds and some perennial weed species were important for the pollinators. The highest number of linkages was established between weed species and phytophagous insects. The number of harmful pest species associated with broad-leaved weeds was low for all species. The general pattern of changes in values of indices over recent decades was similar: there was a marked decline in the values between the 1960s and the 1980s, and a slight increase between the 1980s and the 1990s. These changes were regarded as being a consequence of changes in the intensity of agricultural practices. The slowest recovery of the values was for pollinators. The results suggest that the ecological consequences of changes in the intensity of agriculture can be explored with the aid of a biodiversity indicator based on species interactions. Owing to the differences in the importance of weed species for different animal groups, maintaining weed species richness is necessary to ensure ecosystem services are provided for the higher trophic levels in farmland.

Seeding native grasses for ground cover is an effective practice to protect soil and enhance ecosystem services, but the species to be used should be adapted to the climatic conditions and the particular requirements of each system. Here, we studied seed germination timing of six winter annual grasses: Aegilops triuncialis, Anisantha madritensis, Anisantha rubens, Bromus hordeaceus, Hordeurn nuirinum and Trachynia distachya; with potential for ground cover in olive groves of the Iberian Peninsula. We conducted germination experiments under eight treatments of constant and alternate temperatures and seven treatments of water potential, and fitted hydro- and thermal-time models to assess possible responses of seedbased populations to regional climate. In all species, recently-harvested seeds showed high germination rates across a wide range of temperatures, while winter-stored seeds were highly tolerant to moisture stress. Our results suggest that environmental conditions rather than dormancy prevent germination of the studied species after dispersal. This germination pattern contrasts with the deep physiological dormancy described for winter annuals in temperate climates and desert regions, indicating a special adaptation of the studied populations for the long dry season in Mediterranean climates. We conclude that the regeneration ecology of these widelydistributed grasses makes them an excellent source of seeds for ground cover in Mediterranean woody crops.","43661",2018

Here, we use the concept of citizen science to quantify taxon-specific contributions to dung decomposition at the level of a nation. Young people across Finland manipulated the decomposer communities of cow pats, then measured changes in pat mass over the grazing season. In southern Finland most (90%) of the cattle dung hitting pastures decomposed in just two months, whereas 1100 km to the north the corresponding fraction was smaller (74%). Of the total invertebrate-caused decomposition (13% of dung pat mass, independent of latitude), large tunneling dor beetles in the genus Geotrupes account for 61%, hence removing dung twice as fast as do smaller dung-dwelling beetles and earthworms. Overall, this paper illustrates how ecologists may direct citizen scientists to implement massive ecological experiments. Compared to an approach based purely on professional scientists, we saved three-quarters of the costs. Ultimately, citizen science may offer a key tool for testing current ecological theories at relevant spatial scalesand for disseminating these theories in the process.","NOV",2013

This landscape has been shaped over millenia by disturbances associated with agropastoral land use: clearing, grazing and burning, and by regeneration processes of the natural woody vegetation. The ability to predict the effects of management decisions on the structure and composition of the vegetation is essential for present and future land management. To improve this ability we developed a hierarchical multi-scale, management-responsive model of vegetation dynamics. The model was initially developed at two hierarchically nested spatial scales: ""cell"" (1 m(2)) and ""site"" (400 m(2)). The cell model was conceptually derived from a ""States and transitions"" framework. Vegetation state in a cell was defined by the identity, age and height of the dominant plant functional type. Biological realism was enhanced by defining transition probabilities not as constants but as functions of variables that represent biological processes: reproduction, colonization, expansion, replacement, aging, mortality, grazing, regrowth after fire, and dispersal. Up-scaling to the site was essentially done by averaging: vegetation state of a site was defined by frequencies of cells in different states. However, there was a feedback from site to cell by seed production and dispersal functions. The model was parameterized and implemented for a study area in Mediterranean woody vegetation (garrigue) in Israel. The biological components and processes represented in the model are sufficiently general to allow adaptation to similar vegetation in other Mediterranean regions. A series of simulation experiments over 100 years was carried out under different management scenarios defined by combinations of initial vegetation cover (cleared and control plots), cattle and goat grazing intensity and fire frequency. The results highlight the following trends: In most scenarios, initial cover has an effect even after 100 years. In the absence of any disturbance, vegetation becomes dominated by the two tallest woody functional types. Under extremely intense multiple disturbances (fire + goat grazing), the vegetation becomes dominated by Herbaceous plants. Scenarios of intermediate disturbance regimes often result in heterogeneous vegetation composition. Under most of the management scenarios examined, vegetation composition had not reached a steady state (or steady cycle of fire-regrowth) even after 100 years. The model can be a useful tool for land managers by eliminating obviously undesirable scenarios and focusing on a limited set of desirable or acceptable scenarios. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In estuaries, a decline of overall habitat quality and functioning has led to significant efforts to restore critical ecosystem services, recently through the creation and restoration of oyster reefs. Oyster reef restoration generally occurs with goals of (1) increasing water quality via filtration through sustainable oyster recruitment, (2) stabilizing shorelines, and (3) creating and enhancing critical estuarine habitat for fish and invertebrates. We restored over 260 m(2) of oyster reef habitat in coastal Louisiana and followed the development and provision of these ecosystem services from 2009 through 2012. Oysters recruited to reefs immediately, with densities of oysters greater than 75 mm exceeding 80 ind m(-2) after 3 years, and provision of filtration rates of 1002 perpendicular to 187 L h(-1) m(-2); shoreline stabilization effects of the created reefs were minimal over the three years of monitoring, with some evidence of positive shoreline stabilization during higher wind/energy events only; increased nekton abundance of resident, but not larger transient fish was immediately measurable at the reefs, however, this failed to increase through time. Our results provide critical insights into the development trajectories of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs, as well as the mechanisms mediating these changes. This is critical both ecologically to understand how and where a reef thrives, and for policy and management to guide decision-making related to oyster reef restoration and the crediting and accounting of ecosystem services.

This study aimed to characterize ES supply in deforestation context where an improvement of scientific knowledge should help develop more efficient environmental management. For three case studies in the Brazilian Amazon impacted by deforestation, seven indicators of potential ES supply were mapped at a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m: biodiversity index (indicator of food web support); richness of pollinators (pollination); index of soil chemical quality (support to production); water available for plants (water regulation); soil carbon stocks (support to production and climate regulation); rate of water infiltration into the soil (soil erosion control); and vegetation carbon stocks (climate regulation). To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts. From a methodological viewpoint, the study highlights the importance of choices inherent in all cartographic practices and that need to be considered, especially in the context of rendering ES maps operational.","MAR",2018

We studied two contrasting agricultural landscapes that exist in parallel on two sides of a ditch in the South African Drakensberg Mountains. The large-scale commercial and smallholder farmers operate within a similar biophysical context but have different farming intensities, management practices, socioeconomic positions, ethnic identities, cultural contexts, and land tenure systems. To assess multifunctionality, we examined the ecosystem services coproduced within these two social-ecological systems, by applying a mixed-method approach combining in-depth interviews, participatory mapping, and expert assessments. The results indicate clear differences between the two farming systems and farmer groups in terms of supply, demand, and the capacity of the farmers to influence ecosystem service production within their landscapes. Commercial farmers can generally produce agricultural products to meet their demand and have the capacity to mitigate land degradation and erosion. Smallholder food production is low, and the demand for ecosystem services is high. Since the smallholders lack the resources to mitigate unsustainable use, this leads to overuse and land degradation. Both landscape types manifest aspects of multifunctionality but vary in the outcomes. Unequal access to land; skills; and natural, financial, and technical resources can hamper multifunctionality and the development toward an equitable and sustainable agriculture in South Africa.",NA,2018

M.","FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT","Provision of clean freshwater is an essential ecosystem service that is under increasing pressure worldwide from a variety of conflicting demands. Water yields differ in relation to land-cover type. Successful resource management therefore requires accurate information on yields from alternative vegetation types to adequately address concerns regarding water production. Of particular importance are upper watersheds/catchments, regardless of where water is extracted. Research in New Zealand has shown that, when in good condition, indigenous tall tussock grasslands can maximize water yield relative to other vegetation cover types. A long-term hydrological paired-catchment study revealed reductions (up to 41% after 22 years) in water yielded annually from an afforested catchment relative to adjacent indigenous grassland. Furthermore, a stable isotope assessment showed that water from fog may. substantially contribute to yield in upland tussock grasslands. The tall tussock life-form and its leaf anatomy and physiology, which minimize transpiration loss, appear to be the differentiating factors. Thus, maintaining dominance of such cover is important for water production, especially in upland catchments. Ecological analogues and integrated land-use planning are discussed in the context of this essential ecosystem service. Water management programs in other countries are reviewed and that of South Africa is commended as a model.","FEB",2008

Temperature-dependency of many physiological and ecological processes drives this storage capacity. As opposed to other physiological rates, the temperature-dependence of nutrient uptake by plants has, to date, not been thoroughly investigated and therefore was not explicitly included in food web models. In a meta-study, we extracted experimental data to establish the temperature-dependence of the parameters determining plant nutrient uptake. Overall, we found an increase in the maximum uptake rate, as well as the half-saturation density. As the respiration rates of plants (biomass loss) increase more strongly than the nutrient uptake rates (driving biomass gain under nutrient limitation), our results suggest that warming should decrease plant biomass. We applied these temperature-dependent nutrient uptake rates by plants to a model of a three-level food-chain composed of two nutrients, a plant pool, and an herbivore pool. Having established plant nutrient uptake rates based on real data to replace the previously used assumption of logistic growth, we were able to use realistic natural nutrient deposition rates as the input variables in this model. This mechanistic model approach allowed us to show the quantitative responses of natural communities to realistic fertilization rates for the first time. We ran the model under realistic nutrient supply scenarios based on deposition data from the literature, adding a scenario of anthropogenic fertilization. We found decreases in overall community biomass with increasing temperature, but the intensity of this decrease varied strongly depending on the nutrient supply scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of including other global change drivers besides warming, as they can mediate the temperature impact on changes in global carbon storage and thus biomass-related ecosystem services.","OCT",2019

Water and N budgets were calculated to assess differences in ET, drainage, soil moisture, and N transport following three stormwater applications in July, August, and October of 2006. Evaporative demand was also estimated as potential or reference ET during the study period using Hamon, Priestley-Taylor, and FAO Penman-Monteith models. Results show that after 1 year of establishment, vegetation type changed the water budgets of rain gardens thus altering their provisioning of ecosystem services via observed tradeoffs between daytime evaporative cooling (ET), stormwater storage, N-load reduction, soil and plant N retention, and groundwater recharge (drainage). Vegetation effects on hydrology and N transport were most significant when evaporative demand was high during the middle of the growing season. Observed changes in ET, drainage, soil moisture, and N transport support the incorporation of different vegetation types into conceptual and numerical models of rain gardens to assess ecological outcomes and tradeoffs at a variety of spatiotemporal scales.","DEC",2016

Lagoonal systems, such as Great South Bay (GSB), NY, sit on the interface of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and are prone to anthropogenic stressors but proximity to land also makes the presence of data regarding historic populations and structure more likely. To quantify over a century of ecosystem change, Ecopath models were developed for GSB at each of four time periods where commercial and scientific data exist: 1880s, 1930s, 1980s and 2000s. The results indicated that the GSB has experienced a decline in ecosystem maturity, loss of top keystone predators, a decline in connectivity to the ocean though the reduction of migratory species and increasing dominance of low trophic level organisms. These changes undermine the delivery of ecosystem services, increase conflicts over limited resources and suggest that present day restoration targets fail to recognize appropriate baselines. We discuss the role of stochastic events, which result in state changes that could be defined as regime shifts, and ecosystem connectivity to the long-term stability of lagoonal systems.

In this study, we explored the visions of key stakeholders on the current and future situation of silvopastoral systems in the Sierra Morena mountain range of southern Spain, where extensive livestock grazing is declining because of competition with other more profitable activities, such as intensive olive groves and game hunting. We performed a discourse analysis using Q methodology and evaluated the existing relationships of information exchange and conflict among local institutions such as farmer's associations, the provincial council, and conservation organizations using social network analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders representing local formal and nonformal institutions involved in extensive livestock production. Results showed three distinct discourses among stakeholders related to profitability, conservation, and modernization. There was a strong consensus on the management strategies that should be promoted to support extensive livestock production and preserve the associated silvopastoral systems. Social networks revealed high cohesion and communication exchange and a low level of conflict among stakeholders, with few exceptions. The low influence of livestock producers on policy decision making largely hinders the development of participatory management schemes. Nevertheless, similarities among the visions and opinions of different institutions suggest that new possibilities might emerge for silvopastoral systems through the collaboration among the different socioeconomic sectors present in the area.

However, urban yards showed evidence of homogenization of composition and structure.

As most marine flora and fauna reside in coastal areas, anthropogenic changes to coastlines are a key reason for loss of coastal habitats, and associated ecosystem services. While coastal infrastructure such as seawalls or breakwaters add significant amounts of hard substrate for marine organisms, they do not support similar species assemblages to those of natural habitats. This is mainly due to design features related to steep slopes, low structural complexity, and high homogeneity, all of which are rarely found in natural habitats. This study provides an example for seascape architecture of coastal structures using ecologically sensitive designs and concrete technologies that enhance the structures' biological and ecological value while contributing to structural integrity. Four 1.5 mx0.8 m seawall panels made of bio-enhancing concrete with high structural complexity were deployed in an active marina (Herzliya, Israel). The panels, spanned from the Mean High Higher Water (MHHW) down to the sublittoral zone, were surveyed 2, 7, 12, 18 and 22 months post deployment using 0.3 x 0.3 m quadrats in both intertidal and sublittoral zones of each panel. Bio-enhanced panels were compared to fixed control quadrats comprised of scraped sections of the original concrete marina seawall. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of applying ecological considerations for biological and ecological enhancement of active infrastructure. All community parameters examined (live cover, richness, biodiversity) were significantly higher on bio-enhanced panels compared to controls. Moreover, mobile invertebrates and resident fish species were clearly enhanced through design aspects (holes and crevices) of the bio-enhanced panels. The study provides an example of an emerging approach of assimilating ecological considerations into the design and construction of working waterfronts and active coastal infrastructure, thus reducing their ecological footprint without compromising their operational performance.

We found positive relationships between agricultural land cover and both pollinator generality and robustness to extinctions under several extinction scenarios. Increased robustness was attributable to changes in plant community composition (fewer extinction-prone species) and network structure (increased pollinator generality). Thus, traits enabling persistence in highly agricultural landscapes can confer robustness to potential future perturbations on plant-pollinator networks.","DEC",2018

We present a novel method for studying this combining accessibility analysis and public participatory GIS (PPGIS). Seven environment features are defined and accessibility to them analysed across Stockholm municipality. We estimate the probabilities of positive and negative experiences in places based on these environment features, by using spatial regression to extrapolate from the results of an online PPGIS survey (1784 experiences of 1032 respondents). Six of the seven studied environment features have significant impact on experiential outcome, after accounting for spatial autocorrelation among the data. The results show that number of residents and proximity of nature environments and water, all common quality indicators in urban planning and research, have weak statistically significant effects on people's experiences. However, areas dominated by large working populations or proximity to major roads have very low rates of positive experiences, while areas with high natural temperature regulating capacities have very high rates, showing that there are considerable qualitative differences within urban environments as well as nature environments. Current urban planning practices need to acknowledge these differences to limit impacts on the biosphere while promoting human wellbeing. We suggest that a good way to start addressing this is through transformation of negatively experienced urban areas through designs that integrate closeness to urbanity with possibilities to have nature experiences on a daily basis.","MAR",2018

In this paper we use European floodplain landscapes as example to develop an expert based qualitative conceptual model for the assessment of impacts of landscape scale interventions on multifunctionality. European floodplain landscapes are particularly useful for such approach as they originally provided a high variety and quantity of ESS that has declined due to the strong human impact these landscapes have experienced. We provide an overview of the effects of floodplain management options on landscape multifunctionality by assessing the effects of 38 floodplain management interventions on 21 relevant ESS, as well as on overall ESS supply. We found that restoration and rehabilitation consistently increased the multifunctionality of the landscape by enhancing supply of provisioning, regulation/maintenance, and cultural services. In contrast, conventional technical regulation measures and interventions related to extraction, infrastructure and intensive land use cause decrease in multifunctionality and negative effects for the supply of all three aspects of ESS. The overview of the effects of interventions shall provide guidance for decision makers at multiple governance levels. The presented conceptual model could be effectively applied for other landscapes that have potential for a supply of a high diversity of ESS.","FEB",2014

We also modelled the aesthetic and habitat impacts of fully costed remediation scenarios, including widespread scattered tree planting and densely seeding poor paddocks under temporary stock exclusion. The visualisations revealed to the research team that: (1) dense seeding has a more lasting impact for scattered trees than scattered planting; (2) the benefits of any kind of planting is short-lived if accompanied by conventional grazing practices; and (3) grazed woodlands are most at risk.

While there is general agreement regarding the anthropogenic causes of this phenomenon, its ecological consequences are less certain. We analysed how woody vegetation of differing cover affects plant diversity (richness and evenness) and the surrogates of multiple ecosystem processes (multifunctionality) in global drylands, and how these change with aridity. LocationTwo hundred and twenty-four dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica, widely differing in their environmental conditions (from arid to dry-subhumid sites) and relative woody cover (from 0 to 100%). MethodsUsing a standardized field survey, we measured the cover, richness and evenness of perennial vegetation. At each site, we measured 14 soil variables related to fertility and the build-up of nutrient pools. These variables are critical for maintaining ecosystem functioning in drylands. ResultsSpecies richness and ecosystem multifunctionality were strongly related to woody vegetation, with both variables peaking at a relative woody cover (RWC) of 41-60%. This relationship shifted with aridity. We observed linear positive effects of RWC in dry-subhumid sites. These positive trends shifted to hump-shaped RWC-diversity and multifunctionality relationships under semi-arid environments. Finally, hump-shaped (richness, evenness) or linear negative (multifunctionality) effects of RWC were found under the most arid conditions.

We assess commonly used methods for comparing tree diversity in peri-urban and urban forests when available data have different sample sizes, plot sizes, and sampling intensities. We present methods for appropriately evaluating species richness, as well as methods for comparing species distributions via community data matrices. Using permanent plot data from the southeastern United States, we present a case study comparing urban and peri-urban forests along a north-south gradient, and assessing species richness and the ecological homogenization hypothesis. Our findings indicate that comparisons of tree species richness among communities, or forest types, are often inconclusive since commonly used sample sizes do not provide precise estimates of the number of species present. While the ecological homogenization hypotheses can be tested under conditions of unequal sampling effort, we suggest robust methods such as PERMANOVA and the Raup-Crick dissimilarity index. A framework for selecting appropriate methods is also discussed.

In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes.

Thomas; Bennett, Jonathan A.; Hart, Miranda","FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Although plants are known to have a strong influence on soil biota, the effect of groundcover vegetation in perennial cropping systems on soil fungi has been little explored. We surveyed extensively managed vineyards to determine how plant community functional characteristics, soil factors, and irrigation management related to the abundance of two guilds of soil fungi that may play a role in plant-soil feedback (entomopathogenic fungi represented by Beauveria bassiana, and the pathogenic species complex, Ilyonectria spp.). We found that plant community characteristics were related to fungal abundance for both fungi assayed. Beauveria bassiana increased with native species, annual plants, and legumes consistently across sampling periods. Ilyonectria spp. increased with the abundance of forbs and exotic species, though only the relationship with forbs was consistent across sampling periods. Both fungal guilds increased with increasing soil organic matter. The use of dual or sprinkler irrigation systems also increased B. bassiana and Ilyonectria spp. in vineyard soils. Overall, groundcover vegetation played a significant role in driving abundance of these important groups of soil fungi. Groundcover management may therefore be a viable tool to manipulate soil fungi with the potential for improving ecosystem services such as conservation biological control of soil dwelling insect pests and deterring pathogens in perennial cropping systems.","43565",2019

Using a biophysical model, we mapped six ES in the Manas River Basin, which is a typical MOD area. A questionnaire survey was employed to evaluate social demand for ES and human well-being in four different regional units (i.e., high mountain, low hills, oasis and desert) in our site. Spider diagrams were applied to identify the links among ES supply, social demand and human well-being. The results showed that a high supply of provisioning services occurred in the oasis, while a high supply of regulating services existed in the high mountain region. The ES social demand was not completely accordant with the biophysical supply in spatial distribution, and the factors from the supply side and demand side could both cause ES supply-demand mismatches. The total well-being level of all indicators was higher in the oasis and desert than in the upstream areas (i.e., the high mountain region and low hills region), but some indicators (e.g., water consumption) were the inverse. The supply-demand mismatches in provisioning services had a strong impact on human well-being, while the supply-demand mismatches in regulating services had a low impact on human well-being. This can be explained by the ES social demand questionnaire results, which showed that the level of social importance was higher for provisioning services than for regulating services at our site. In accordance with our results, we recommended several policies to promote ecological conservation and improve human well-being in the Manas River Basin, and these policies could also be applied in other MOD areas.

Consuming dead animal matter and recycling its nutrients stabilizes and structures food webs and therefore represents a key component of ecosystem functioning. Introduction of free-ranging domestic pet animals adds additional scavenger species to urban habitats, and increased predictability of carcass resources produced by human activities characterizes urban habitats. Here, we investigate the effect of urbanization on the composition of diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages and on the ecological function of carcass removal by using a carcass placement experiment in Swiss urban and adjacent rural habitats. While diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages changed considerably from rural to urban areas by comprising particularly more domestic cats in the latter, carrion consumption rate did not differ between the two habitats. Predictability of carcass occurrence increased carrion consumption rate in both urban and rural habitats but mainly native scavengers and not introduced domestic pets responded to the repeated placements. These results suggest that urbanization shapes scavenger assemblage compositions without affecting their ecological function. The mechanism is likely due to a behavioural change of native scavengers in response to the occurrence of domestic pets resulting in functional plasticity of urban scavenger assemblages. The functional plasticity might be facilitated by the increased carcass predictability and additional anthropogenic food resources in urban habitats exploited by nutritionally flexible native scavenger species.

Yet, urban ES assessments often ignore the complex spatial heterogeneity and land-use history of cities. Soil-based services may be particularly susceptible to land-use legacy effects. We studied indicators of three soil-based ES, carbon storage, water quality regulation, and runoff regulation, in a historically agricultural urban landscape and asked (1) How do ES indicators vary with contemporary land cover and time since development? (2) Do ES indicators vary primarily among land-cover classes, within land-cover classes, or within sites? (3) What is the relative contribution of urban land-cover classes to potential citywide ES provision? We measured biophysical indicators (soil carbon [C], available phosphorus [P], and saturated hydraulic conductivity [K-s]) in 100 sites across five land-cover classes, spanning an similar to 125-year gradient of time since development within each land-cover class. Potential for ES provision was substantial in urban green spaces, including developed land. Runoff regulation services (high K-s) were highest in forests; water quality regulation (low P) was highest in open spaces and grasslands; and open spaces and developed land (e.g., residential yards) had the highest C storage. In developed land covers, both C and P increased with time since development, indicating effects of historical land-use on contemporary ES and trade-offs between two important ES. Among-site differences accounted for a high proportion of variance in soil properties in forests, grasslands, and open space, while residential areas had high within-site variability, underscoring the leverage city residents have to improve urban ES provision. Developed land covers contributed most ES supply at the citywide scale, even after accounting for potential impacts of impervious surfaces. Considering the full mosaic of urban green space and its history is needed to estimate the kinds and magnitude of ES provided in cities, and to augment regional ES assessments that often ignore or underestimate urban ES supply.","APR",2018

In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genesthe basic constituent of biodiversity.","JUL",2018

Long-term data from permanent vegetation plots have yielded a wealth of data on the species diversity and dynamics of tree populations, but such studies have only rarely been undertaken in tropical forest landscapes that support large human populations. Thus, anthropogenic drivers and their impacts on species diversity and community structure of tropical forests are not well understood. Here we present data on species diversity, community composition, and regeneration status of tropical forests in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Ghats of southern India.

However, few studies have analyzed both the supply and demand sides of ES bundles, i.e., sets of associated ES that repeatedly appear together across time or space. This paper advances a framework to identify, map and assess ES bundles from a supply-demand approach to informlandscape planning and management. The framework is applied to the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, covering five ES and using eleven spatial indicators. Each indicator was quantified and mapped at the municipal level (n = 164) combining different proxy-and process-based models. Our results show significant associations among ES, both at the supply and demand sides. Further, we identified five distinct ES supply-demand bundle types and characterized them based on their specific ES relationships and their main underlying social-ecological conditions. From our findings, we contend that land sharing strategies should be prioritized in urban and agricultural areas to increase landscape multifunctionality while assuring the conservation of large periurban forest areas that are critical for delivering a wide range of local ES highly demanded by the urban population.

The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of places that harbor traditional ecological knowledge, artifacts, and methods when preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services in landscapes of food production. We use three examples in Europe of biocultural refugia, defined as the physical places that not only shelter farm biodiversity, but also carry knowledge and experiences about practical management of how to produce food while stewarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. Memory carriers include genotypes, landscape features, oral, and artistic traditions and self-organized systems of rules, and as such reflect a diverse portfolio of practices on how to deal with unpredictable change. We find that the rich biodiversity of many regionally distinct cultural landscapes has been maintained through different smallholder practices developed in relation to local environmental fluctuations and carried within biocultural refugia for as long as millennia. Places that transmit traditional ecological knowledge and practices hold important lessons for policy makers since they may provide genetic and cultural reservoirs - refugia - for the wide array of species that have co-evolved with humans in Europe for more than 6000 thousand yrs. Biodiversity restoration projects in domesticated landscapes can employ the biophysical elements and cultural practices embedded in biocultural refugia to create locally adapted small-scale mosaics of habitats that allow species to flourish and adapt to change. We conclude that such insights must be included in discussions of land-sparing vs. land-sharing when producing more food while combating loss of biodiversity. We found the latter strategy rational in domesticated landscapes with a long history of agriculture.",NA,2013

Natural or non-crop habitat has strongly positive effects on natural enemies in cropland, but the resulting impact on pests is not as well established. This study measured weekly natural enemy (syrphid fly larvae) and pest (cabbage aphid) abundances in Central California broccoli fields for three years. Abundance of syrphid fly larvae increased strongly with the proportion of natural habitat surrounding the farm. As the density of syrphid fly larvae increased, weekly aphid population growth rates slowed, such that aphid densities just prior to harvest were lowest in farms with natural habitat. These landscape-mediated impacts of syrphids on aphids were not evident when data were aggregated into annual averages, a common metric in research on pest control services. We suggest that higher temporal resolution of data for natural enemy and pest abundance can reveal top-down control that is otherwise masked by seasonal and interannual variation in environmental factors.

The structural and functional consequences of such extinctions can be explored by means of computer simulations that try to predict secondary extinctions and the degradation of ecosystem services. However, to improve the accuracy of these simulations, it is pivotal to evaluate their performance in predicting changes observed in natural communities. In this study, we first described the avian seed dispersal networks in 17 sites throughout Portugal, and found that blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius) was the most dispersed species in 13 out of the 17 sites. Second, we performed a manipulative experiment to evaluate the effect of removing the most dispersed plant species and compared the observed outcome in the structure of the network with computer simulations with and without rewiring. Observed changes were consistent with some rapid network rewiring, with dispersers shifting to alternative fruit species. Although the observed network topology after the experimental removal was not accurately predicted, the extinction simulation with rewiring performed considerably better than that without rewiring. Individual species roles were even harder to predict than emergent network properties on both types of models. We show that incorporating rewiring rules can considerably increase the accuracy of species extinction models, however, the functional consequences of losing important resources might not be easily anticipated, and rewiring might occur in unexpected directions.

In the nearshore seabed of temperate zones (e.g. Mediterranean Sea and South Australia), marine biogenic carbonates are mainly produced inside sea-grass meadows. This study quantifies the contribution of biogenic sediments, mainly produced in Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows and secondarily in photophilic algal communities, to the sediment budget of a Mediterranean beach-dune system (San Giovanni beach, western Sardinia, western Mediterranean Sea). A set of geophysical, petrographic and sedimentological data was used to estimate the sediment volume and composition of the beach-dune system as a whole. The San Giovanni beach-dune system contains 3797000 +/- 404000 t of sediment, 83% (3137000 +/- 404000 t) of which is located in the coastal wedge, 16% (619000 +/- 88000 t) in the dune fields and 1% (41000 +/- 15000 t) in the sub-aerial beach. The sediments are composed of mixed modern bioclastic and relict bioclastic and non-bioclastic grains from various sources. The system receives a large input of modern bioclastic grains, mainly composed of rhodophytes, molluscs and bryozoans, which derive from sediment production of present-day carbonate factories, particularly P. oceanica seagrass meadows. Radiocarbon dating of modern bioclastic grains indicated that they were produced during the last 4.37 kyr. This value was used to estimate the longterm deposition rates of modern bioclastic sediments in the various beach compartments. The total deposition rate of modern bioclastic grains is 46000 +/- 5000 t century 1, mainly deposited in the coastal wedge (39000 +/- 4000 t century(-1)) and dunes (7000 +/- 1000 t century(-1)), and 46 000 t represents similar to 1.2% of the total beach-dune sediment mass. Carbonate production from coastal ecosystems was estimated to be 132000/307000 t century(-1), 28% (15%/34 %) of which is transported to the beach-dune system, thus significantly contributing to the beach sediment budget. The contribution to the beach sediment budget represents a further ecosystem service, which our data can help quantify, provided by P. oceanica. The value of this sediment-supply service is in addition to the other important ecological services provided by seagrass meadows. The dependence of the beach sediment budget on carbonate production associated with coastal ecosystems has several implications for the adaptation of mixed and carbonate beaches to the loss of seagrass meadows due to local impacts and the changes expected to occur over the next few decades in coastal ecosystems following sea level rise.","43651",2017

We examined the magnitude of human impact on fire by comparing fire regime between individual 1-km(2) grid cells designated for fire suppression with lands where fires are allowed to burn naturally. Two-thirds of interior Alaska has an essentially natural fire regime, with few human ignitions, negligible suppression activity, and many large lightning-caused fires. In the 17% of land that is designated for fire suppression due to its proximity to communities and roads, there was a 50% reduction in the proportion of area burned from 1992-2001, relative to areas without suppression. The remaining 16% of land serves as a buffer, receives some suppression, and has an intermediate fire regime. Even though there were 50 times more fires and the fire season began two months earlier in lands designated for suppression, most of these fires were lit by people and remained small because fires tended to occur at times and places less favorable for fire spread and were more accessible to fire fighters compared to lands not designated for suppression. Even in the absence of fire suppression, human-caused fires were less likely to exceed 400 ha compared to lightning-caused fires. Fire suppression reduced area burned in all fuel types but was somewhat more effective in less flammable (non-forest) vegetation. Alaska's fire policy of focusing suppression efforts on a small proportion of the fire-prone region maximizes the ecological and social benefits associated with fire-dependent ecosystem services, while minimizing the social and ecological costs of suppression. Application of this policy to other areas would require well-informed managers and stakeholders to make difficult decisions about the relative costs and benefits of fire across ecologically and culturally variable landscapes.","DEC",2006

We analysed historical, ecological and land use data to understand the threats to native vegetation, and prospects for future recovery in the wheat-sheep zone of the Wimmera and Mallee in southeastern Australia. We analysed air photos, surveyed 60 remnant vegetation sites, and interviewed land managers about a subset of 35 remnants. Our analysis confirmed that soil types favoured for cropping were largely cleared before 1945; mean cover declined from 8% to 5% between 1945 and 2000. Small patches (<5 ha) account for a quarter of remaining woody cover. Cover of crops increased at the expense of pasture. Small patches were typically frequently grazed, nutrient enriched and were dominated by an exotic annual understorey. Recruitment of woody species was uncommon, and non-existent in the small patches. Landholders valued small patches primarily for stock shelter but without recruitment their long-term persistence is doubtful, even though most farmers are grazing less now compared with 30 years ago. Meeting regional native vegetation cover targets likely depends on retention of all existing vegetation patches, plus considerable revegetation. However, although current land use trends allow the sparing of some marginal lands while cropping intensifies, this option cannot satisfy vegetation cover targets and may not preserve biodiversity. More significant gains in native vegetation cover may not occur unless new opportunities arise for the current cohort of farmers. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, understanding the dynamics of farmland seed food resources for species of conservation concern is of considerable research interest. We examined the distribution of berries and soil-surface seeds in the managed and unmanaged habitats of a 125 ha organic farm. We took soil suction-samples over a year, counted and identified all seeds, and compared abundances and species-richness between habitats. We constructed ecological networks from literature records and by rearing insects to investigate the importance of these seeds for insects, birds and mammals. We predicted the impacts of management on seed biomass, energy and the ecosystem service of pest control across the whole farm. We estimated seed and berry food resources of up to 33 metric tons of biomass and 560 GJ of energy on the farm. Potentially, more than 330 species use the seeds as a food resource, the overwhelming majority of which are invertebrates (82%) relying predominantly on non-crop and weed species. Generally, uncultivated semi-natural habitats such as woodland and mature hedgerows were more species-rich and had higher seed biomass and energy than crop habitats throughout the year, but fallow land was disproportionately important for seeds during the summer. Models of increased management intensity revealed declines of up to 19% in seed biomass and energy and cascades through the network that resulted in a substantial decrease in potentially pest-controlling parasitoids.

Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes. 2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods. 3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10%-20%) at large spatial scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low (<10%) at small (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20%) at large spatial scales. 4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.","SEP",2018

Semi-structured interviews and geographical information system sources were used to map the supply-side, whereas 205 face-to-face questionnaires were distributed to assess and map the demand-side. Our results show the existence of consistent ecosystem service bundles in terms of both the supply- and demand-sides, particularly between erosion control-recreational hunting and between mushroom harvesting-nature tourism. We found a spatial scale mismatch for the erosion control, with its supply at the local scale and its demand at the regional-national scales, with implications at the institutional scale at which it should be managed. Consequently, mapping both the supply- and demand-sides is essential for environmental decision making because it can indicate where management interventions should be focused, either by defining high-priority areas for protection or defining the institutional scale at which these services should be managed.

One of the reasons for this low implementation is the insufficient thematic and spatial detail in UES research to provide guidance for urban planners and managers. Acknowledging how patterns of UES delivery are related with vegetation structure and composition in urban green areas could help these stakeholders to target structural variables that increase UES provision. This investigation explored how different types of urban green spaces influence UES delivery in Porto, a Portuguese city, and how this variation is affected by a socioeconomic gradient. A stepwise approach was developed using two stratification schemes and a modelling tool to estimate urban forest structure and UES provision. This approach mapped explicit cold and hotspots of UES provision and discriminated the urban forest structural variables that influence UES at the local scale. Results revealed that different types of green spaces affect UES delivery as a direct result of the influence of structural variables of the urban forest. Furthermore, the uneven distribution of green spaces types across socioeconomic strata alters UES delivery across the city. This case study illustrates how a methodology adaptable to other geographic contexts can be used to map and analyze coupled social and ecological patterns, offering novel insights that are simple to understand and apply by urban planners and managers.","FEB",2018

The role of prescribed burning of vegetation to manage fire risk is controversial in a variety of situations worldwide. It is becoming more topical (i) as a result of potential global warming where the risk of wildfire might increase and (ii) because fire might affect the various ecosystem services provided in a different way. Where prescribed fire is used, ecologists need to know the impact on biodiversity (post-fire recovery) and on provisioning and regulating services such as water collection and carbon sequestration. Here, we assess the effect of prescribed burning on plant community composition and its component species at the regional scale of the Peak District, where the moorland vegetation is severely degraded. 2. Species cover (%) was assessed on five moors with respect to elapsed time since prescribed burning and vegetation height. A stratified random method was used to choose burn patches covering a range of ages since burning; quadrats were then sampled randomly within these patches over a 3-year period. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to relate species composition to significant environmental variables, and variation partitioning was used to assess their relative contribution. Response curves were produced for the major species with respect to elapsed time since burning and vegetation height. 3. The species ordination produced two gradients, (i) a continuum from a graminoid-dominated vegetation to one dominated by Erica tetralix, Vaccinium myrtillus and Rubus chamaemorus and (ii) a post-fire growth response of the dominant species, Calluna vulgaris. Species composition was more highly correlated with vegetation height than elapsed time since burning. The environmental variables explained 15.2% of the variation. 4. Calluna vulgaris was the only species to show an increasing response after burning; all others showed an increase immediately after burning, but then they either decreased or showed a unimodal/skewed response. Most other species were restricted to vegetation <40 cm height and 20-25 years after burning. 5. Synthesis and applications. We found two major results of importance to policy makers and land managers: (i) that prescribed burning maintains species diversity in the immediate post-burn phase, and (ii) as the vegetation ages and increases in height, most species disappear and the vegetation becomes dominated by C. vulgaris. From a policy perspective, prescribed burning (or some other disturbance) is needed to maintain burning and a no-burn policy will result in a low-diversity, C. vulgaris-dominated vegetation. As vegetation height is the easiest measure for land managers to use in judging when to burn, we recommend moorland vegetation be burned before it reaches 25 cm in height to maintain the pre-burn complement of plant species. If the rotation allows the vegetation to become much taller (>40 cm), then most species will be lost and they will have to colonize after subsequent fires from the seedbank or from the surrounding area.","DEC",2011

Here we integrate field sampling, insect marking, insecticide disruption, and molecular gut content analysis to explore the potential value of non-crop habitats to predators of brassica pests in temperate Australia. Twelve monthly surveys of 13 farms established that an exotic ladybird (Hippodamia variegata) and a native lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae) were numerically dominant predatory arthropod species in brassica crops and present in adjacent perennial pasture, bushland and riparian vegetation. We applied dye to non-crop vegetation on three sites and subsequently sampled predators from adjacent brassica crops. Relatively large proportions of H. variegata and M. tasmaniae were marked, especially close to the non-crop vegetation though also extending 100 m into the crop, indicating predator immigration into the crop. In a third study, predators were monitored in three brassica crops after the host farmers sprayed insecticide to control what they considered to be excessive pest densities. Within two days, H. variegata and M. tasmaniae adults were present in the crops and numbers increased significantly over 12 days showing rapid crop recolonisation. Finally, molecular gut analysis indicated large proportions of both predator species sampled from non-crop (non-brassica) vegetation contained DNA of brassica-specialist herbivores suggesting predator movement from crop to non-crop vegetation, possibly to access nectar. Findings demonstrate H. variegata and M. tasmaniae are likely to be important predators of brassica pests in the region and expand our understanding of the significance of non-crop vegetation for coccinellids and lacewings.

Human adaptation is often considered a key uncertainty, and there are few quantitative empirical analyses that address long-term social and ecological change in the analyses of fisheries systems. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to understand how different drivers influenced the adaptations by fishers, and (ii) to evaluate different consequences of such adaptations, especially with regard to diversity of social and ecological links. We used the Baltic Sea as a case study, a system with different fisheries, largely managed with a single-stock advice, in a top-down basis. The study period 1995-2009 was characterized by profound inter-annual fluctuations in fish stock status and prices, and introduction of new types of management measures. We used multivariate statistical methods to define longitudinal changes in fishing tactics and strategies based on logbook data. Our results indicate that changes in fishing strategies have mainly been driven by regulations, and there were only weak linkages between fishing activities, fish stocks, and price fluctuations. We found contrasting trends between large- and small-scale fishers, where large-scale fishers became more specialized and inflexible, whereas small-scale fishers diversified over time. We conclude that management has had a dominating role in shaping fishing patterns, leading to a reduction of important qualities related to the resilience in this social-ecological system.","JAN",2015

They are important for providing ecosystem services such as sources of clean water and air, wildlife habitat, ecosystem biodiversity, recreation, and aesthetics. The National Resources Inventory (NRI) is a primary data source for ongoing assessment of nonfederal land in the United States, including rangelands, and the data collected during an NRI assessment is typical of rangeland monitoring conducted by managers. This study outlines a methodology for using that type of monitoring data to run a rangeland hydrology and erosion model in order to estimate the relative soil erosion rates across ecosystems located in the American Southwest. The model was run on 134 NRI rangeland field locations with data collected between 2003 and 2006 in Major Land Resource Area 41, the Southeastern Arizona Basin and Range, which is a diverse ecological area of 40,765 km(2) (15, 739 mi(2)) in the transition zone between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. Results of the study showed that the data collected was adequate to run the model and effectively assess the influence of foliar cover, ground cover, plant life forms, soils, and topography on current soil erosion rates. Results suggested that the model could be further improved with additional measured experimental data on infiltration, runoff, and soil erosion within key ecological sites in order to better quantify model parameters to reflect ecosystem changes and risk of crossing interdependent biotic and abiotic thresholds.","NOV-DEC",2013

J.","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","Methods for assessing habitat sensitivity to human impacts are needed to gauge the sustainability of existing impacts, develop spatial management plans and support meaningful environmental impact assessments. These methods should be quantitative, validated, repeatable and applicable at the scales of impact and management. Existing methods for assessing the sensitivity of marine habitats to human impacts have tended to rely on expert judgement and/or scoring systems. They are neither validated, quantitative nor repeatable. We have developed a method that meets the criteria for assessing the sensitivity of seabed habitats to physical disturbance, and delineating and mapping habitat sensitivity at large spatial scales (> 10(5) km(2)). The method assumes that sensitivity is related to the recovery time of production or biomass, as predicted using a size-based model that takes account of the effects of natural disturbance. As trawling disturbance is a major and widespread direct human impact on shelf seas, this was used as an example of anthropogenic physical disturbance. We mapped habitat sensitivity to trawling in 9-km(2) boxes across an area of 125 000 km(2) in the North Sea. Habitat sensitivities varied widely, and a trawling frequency of 5 year(-1) in the least-sensitive habitat had the same ecological effect as a trawling frequency of 0.3 year(-1) in the most-sensitive habitat (based on production). When trawling effort was held constant but redirected to the least-sensitive habitats, the existing impacts on production and biomass were reduced by 36% and 25%, respectively. Synthesis and applications. The method described in this paper enables managers to predict the implications of changing patterns of human impact on seabed habitats when establishing spatial management plans. In the context of fisheries management, this will support the identification and selection of fishing grounds that minimize the adverse ecological effects of fishing; the selection of closed areas (both representative and highly sensitive); the comparison of management options that might reduce the overall environmental impacts of fishing; and any future steps towards the application of environmental impact assessment in advance of fishery development.","APR",2007

The expected increasing intensity of hurricanes due to climate change raises questions concerning the capacity of mangroves to resist and recover from such disturbances. Herein, this study contributes to a better understanding of (1) the relation between storm intensity and damage to mangrove vegetation, (2) the contributions of species-specific as well as stand-specific components of mangrove vegetation to ecosystem resistance, and (3) the recovery of pre-hurricane forest structure through time. The first two issues have been addressed using a stand-level approach implemented at two east Caribbean mangrove sites in response to three storm events. The third was addressed through a 23-yr survey of forest recovery following the passage of a high-energy storm across one of the two study sites. Generally, hurricane damage was primarily controlled by wind velocity, followed by the hydro-geomorphic context of mangrove forests and species-specific composition, respectively. The relationship between damage to trees and wind velocity evidenced a sigmoidal trend, with a maximum slope at a wind velocity averaging 130 and 180 km/h for higher vs. lower canopy stands, respectively. The red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, was significantly less resistant to hurricane damage than was the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans. Unlike the fringe and scrub stands, inner, tall-canopy stands fully recovered by the end of the study (23 yr). These stands were more resilient because of their growth performances. Finally, the time for east Caribbean mangroves to recover from high-energy storms seems to fall within the range of the average return time of such disturbances. This may prevent such ecosystems from ever reaching a steady state.","JUL",2018

In order to alleviate severe soil erosion, China has implemented historically unprecedented large-scale afforestation. In this study, we selected the most severely eroded Loess Plateau as a case, to assess the effectiveness of soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. In addition, the underlying drivers for soil erosion changes and hydrological effects of SWC were investigated, and finally the potential policy implications of our findings were discussed. The soil erosion intensity from 2000 to 2015 was weakened largely due to favorable climate conditions and SWC efforts, which promoted vegetation restoration and enhanced soil retention. However, there was a significant trade-off between water provision and soil retention functions. The excessively artificial afforestation reduced sediment yield but depleted surface runoff. Furthermore, artificial afforestation and increasing irrigation water consumption overused groundwater resources and finally lowered groundwater table. The SWC efforts characterized by artificial afforestation induced soil moisture declining, particularly for the conversion type of farmland to forest/ shrub. Our results suggested that afforestation might be a poor choice in arid and semiarid regions, because it did not consider local precipitation conditions, and have exacerbated water shortages and offset SWC efforts. Therefore, the future ecological restoration efforts should be transformed from simple species-based measures to optimal plant species combinations to minimize the tradeoff between water yield and soil retention. The strategies for ecological restoration of drylands should also account for water balance to ensure effectiveness and sustainability.","FEB",2019

Homogenization has led to a decline in biodiversity and a degradation of ecosystem services; for instance, biological pest control. Bats have been fairly invisible service providers and the effect of landscape structural changes on them is poorly understood. We assessed the relative roles of woody habitats and the composition of agricultural landscapes on the diversity and activity of bats in southern Estonia. The study applied a stratified double-point sampling scheme in 30 rural landscape windows comprised of three habitat types, where bats were recorded using automated recording devices. The structure of each stand was described, and the typology of solitary trees, linear objects (alleys and tree-lines) and woodland patches was transformed into a continuous gradient of tree density to simplify the extrapolation of results. Among 10 species and the Myotis brandtii/mystacinus complex, Eptesicus nilssonii and Pipistrellus nathusii prevailed. Species richness and the flight activity of bats were the highest in woodlands, as expected. Linear corridors and solitary trees shared relatively equal richness, while flight activity was three times higher around double-tree-lines (alleys) than around single-tree-lines and solitary trees. Such a pattern was log-linearly related to tree density. Large-scale factors, such as landscape structure and the local species pool, were important drivers for both response indicators; flight activity was additionally dictated by a stand's vertical structure. We conclude that in order to promote bat diversity and the service potentially provided to agriculture, future agri-environmental schemes should incorporate multi-scale management planning: (i) coordinated establishment or maintenance of alleys and small woodland patches within field complexes over neighbouring farms in the scale of several kilometres; (ii) forming water bodies in the vicinity of woody habitats to improve the landscape quality for bats; and (iii) paying special attention on the preservation of old and low branching trees in each woody habitat type.

The highly acidic and compacted soils inherent to this region require thorough physical and chemical conditioning in order for intensive cropping systems to be established. Assessing the impact of this dramatic soil perturbation on biodiversity, ecosystem services and other elements of the natural capital is an urgent task for designing sustainable management options in the region. To address this need, we evaluated soil macro invertebrate communities and soil-based ecosystem services (climate regulation, hydrologic functions, soil stability provided by macro aggregation and nutrient provision potential) in four major production systems: improved pastures, annual crops (rice, corn and soy bean), oil palm and rubber plantations, and compared them to the original savanna. Fifteen plots of each system were sampled along a 200 km natural gradient of soil and climatic conditions. In each plot, we assessed climate regulation by measuring green house gas emissions (N2O, CH4 and CO2) and C storage in aboveground plant biomass and soil (0-20 cm). Soil biodiversity (macro invertebrate communities) and three other soil-based ecosystem services, were assessed using sets of 12-20 relevant variables associated with each service and synthesized via multivariate analyses into a single indicator for each ecosystem function, adjusted in a range of 0.1-1.0. Savannas yielded intermediate values for most indicators, while each production system appeared to improve at least one ecosystem service. For example, nutrient provision (chemical fertility) was highest in annual cropping systems (0.78 +/- 0.03) due to relatively high concentrations of Ca, Mg, N, K, and available P and low Al saturation. Hydrological functions and climate regulation (C storage and GHG emissions) were generally improved by perennial crops (oil palm and rubber), while indicators for macro invertebrate biodiversity and activity (0.73 +/- 0.05) and soil macro aggregation (0.76 +/- 0.02) were highest within improved pastures. High variability within each system indicates the potential to make improvements in fields with lowest indicator values, while differences among systems suggest the potential to mitigate negative impacts by combining plots with contrasted functions in a strategically designed landscape mosaic.

Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer. We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.","OCT",2014

To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

Biological invasions are a common result of anthropogenic habitat change, and numerous studies have established the negative impact of invasions on the diversity and abundance of native species. But fewer studies have directly examined the effect of biological invasions on ecosystem functions and services. We leveraged a recent invasion by the big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) in an East African savanna to evaluate the impact of invasion on arthropod diversity, and on dung-decomposition, an ecosystem function provided by a subset of these arthropods. We found that invaded sites had lower overall arthropod diversity, but these diversity changes did not extend to a functional group of detritivorous insects (e.g., dung beetles and termites), which play key roles in dung-decomposition. In a manipulative experiment, we found that rates of dung pile decomposition did not differ significantly in invaded vs. non-invaded sites. Our study provides evidence that these invaded savannas are undergoing large changes in arthropod diversity, while maintaining resilience in decomposition function, suggesting that diversity alone may be an insufficient impact assessment tool. By monitoring functional guilds and their attendant services, we may better understand the broader structural and functional consequences of invasion.","OCT",2016

We investigated shifts in organic carbon quantity and quality associated with urbanization and ecosystem restoration, and its potential effects on denitrification at the riparian-stream interface. Field measurements of streamwater chemistry, organic carbon characterization, and laboratory-based denitrification experiments were completed at two forested, two restored, and two unrestored urban streams at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site, Maryland, USA. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate loads increased with runoff according to a power-law function that varied across sites. Stable isotopes and molar C:N ratios suggested that stream particulate organic matter (POM) was a mixture of periphyton, leaves, and grass that varied across site types. Stable-isotope signatures and lipid biomarker analyses of sediments showed that terrestrial organic carbon sources in streams varied as a result of riparian vegetation. Laboratory experiments indicated that organic carbon amendments significantly increased rates of denitrification (35.1 +/- 9.4 ng N.[g dry sediment](-1).h(-1); mean +/- SE) more than nitrate amendments (10.4 +/- 4.0 ng N.[g dry sediment](-1).h(-1)) across streamflow conditions and sites. Denitrification experiments with naturally occurring carbon sources showed that denitrification was significantly higher with grass clippings from home lawns (1244 +/- 331 ng N.g dry sediment(-1).h(-1)), and overall unrestored urban sites showed significantly higher denitrification rates than restored and forest sites.

In this paper we use X-ray computed tomography to quantify and characterize the pore geometry at microscopic scales (30 mu m) that are relevant for fungal spread in soil. We analysed the pore geometry for replicated samples with bulk-densities ranging from 1.2-1.6 g/cm(3). The bulk-density of soils significantly affected the total volume, mean pore diameter and connectivity of the pore volume. A previously described fungal growth model comprising a minimal set of physiological processes required to produce a range of phenotypic responses was used to analyse the effect of these geometric descriptors on fungal invasion, and we showed that the degree and rate of fungal invasion was affected mainly by pore volume and pore connectivity.

Although closely related species often have similar feeding ecology, species within the family Cichlidae display a broad spectrum of trophic niches, and resource partitioning has been inferred from studies conducted in Neotropical rivers. We investigated interspecific variation in food resource use and its relationship to morphological variation among cichlid fishes within the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve, a coastal area encompassing the delta of the Grijalva-Usumacinta River in Tabasco, Mexico. Most species consumed benthic crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, and detritus, but some were more herbivorous, and one species was a specialized piscivore. Dietary niche overlap among species was higher than expected for one assemblage, and similar to random expectations for another, suggesting a lesser role for resource partitioning than has been shown for some cichlid assemblages, perhaps due to availability of abundant resources, even in low-water conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that greatest morphological differences am7ong species involved functional traits directly associated with resource use. Relationships between feeding ecology and morphology were similar to those described for other riverine cichlids. Strong ecomorphological relationships facilitate inferences about the ecology of cichlid species, including species that currently lack data from field studies.

Most studies on diversity-functioning relationships have focused on ecosystem and community levels, leaving the extension of those relationships to other organization levels, such as populations, as a challenging and unsolved issue. Empirical studies have shown links between pollinator diversity and plant fecundity, suggesting that a diversity-functioning relationship at the population level may occur in pollination systems. We theoretically explored the effect of pollinator diversity on plant reproduction. We found that low pollinator diversity is beneficial when the most abundant pollinators are the most effective. In contrast, when the most effective pollinators are not the most abundant, we found an optimal value of pollinator diversity at which plant fecundity is maximized. When we parametrized our model with real data, we obtained that an increase in pollinator diversity was beneficial for the reproduction of some plants whereas it was harmful for other plants, the outcome depending exclusively on the differences in effectiveness among pollinators. Consequently, our theoretical approach suggests that in pollination systems the diversity-function relationship may be explained as the consequence of the interaction between among-pollinator differences in effectiveness and frequency of interaction, without the need to invoke additional ecological mechanisms.","SEP",2009

Unfortunately, these areas also receive pollutants released into oceanic and riverine waters. Six years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in US history, the complexity of ecological injuries in this system is just now being elucidated. Here, we describe a novel pathway of injury from oil spills by documenting how the loss of oysters near marsh edge as a direct result of shoreline oiling and clean-up activities can double rates of coastal erosion. As part of the natural resource damage assessment, we examined the impact of shoreline oiling on eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica near the marsh edge at 187 sites in Louisiana and Mississippi Sound in 2013. For marshes that experienced heavy oiling, oyster habitat was 77% less abundant than in areas where no oil was observed. Areas near marshes characterized by more moderate levels of oiling had 33% less oyster habitat than areas where no oil was observed. Similarly, the number of sites without any oyster habitat was higher in heavily and persistently oiled areas compared to areas where no oil was observed (56 vs. 24%). The consequences of this loss are substantial and include loss of essential fish habitat, reduced nutrient cycling, and decreased erosion buffering. For a subset of the sites where erosion rate was also measured between 2010 and 2013 (n = 79), shoreline loss was more than twice as high (2.1 vs. 0.9 m yr(-1)) in areas lacking oyster cover.

There is, however, little direct evidence of yield benefits from ecological intensification on commercial farms growing globally important foodstuffs (grains, oilseeds and pulses). We replicated two treatments removing 3 or 8% of land at the field edge from production to create wildlife habitat in 50-60 ha patches over a 900 ha commercial arable farm in central England, and compared these to a business as usual control (no land removed). In the control fields, crop yields were reduced by as much as 38% at the field edge. Habitat creation in these lower yielding areas led to increased yield in the cropped areas of the fields, and this positive effect became more pronounced over 6 years. As a consequence, yields at the field scale were maintained-and, indeed, enhanced for some crops-despite the loss of cropland for habitat creation.

However, the role of landscape heterogeneity in sustaining hydrologic services at scales relevant to landscape management decisions is poorly understood. In particular, the relative importance of landscape composition (type and proportion of land cover) and configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) is unclear. We analyzed indicators of production of three hydrologic services (freshwater supply, surface and ground water quality) in 100 subwatersheds in an urbanizing agricultural landscape (Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA) and asked: (1) How do landscape composition and configuration affect supply of hydrologic services (i.e., does spatial pattern matter)? (2) Are there opportunities for small changes in landscape pattern to produce large gains in hydrologic services? Landscape composition and configuration both affected supply of hydrologic services, but composition was consistently more important than configuration for all three services. Together landscape composition and configuration explained more variation in indicators of surface-water quality than in freshwater supply or groundwater quality (Nagelkerke/adjusted R-2 : 86%, 64%, and 39%, respectively). Surface-water quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and positively correlated with percent forest, grassland and wetland. In addition, surface-water quality was greater in subwatersheds with higher wetland patch density, disaggregated forest patches and lower contagion. Surface-water quality responded nonlinearly to percent cropland and wetland, with greater water quality where cropland covered below 60% and/or wetland above 6% of the subwatershed. Freshwater supply was negatively correlated with percent wetland and urban cover, and positively correlated with urban edge density. Groundwater quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and grassland, and configuration variables were unimportant. Collectively, our study suggests that altering spatial arrangement of land cover will not be sufficient to enhance hydrologic services in an agricultural landscape. Rather, the relative abundance of land cover may need to change to improve hydrologic services. Targeting subwatersheds near the cropland or wetland thresholds may offer local opportunities to enhance surface-water quality with minimal land-cover change.","NOV",2015

However, the relative merits of conserving versus increasing non-production perennial vegetation (NPPV) are not well understood despite the universal conflicts among such objectives in rapidly urbanizing and intensifying agricultural regions worldwide. Hence, using the most intensive agricultural region of British Columbia, Canada as a case study, we aimed to (i) evaluate the current status of NPPV in terms of carbon stocks and landscape connectivity metrics (ii) compare options for conservation relative to agricultural expansion in terms of maintenance of landscape multifunctionality (iii) identify management options for NPPV that could maximize ecological benefits using a normative scenario analysis. We determined that 83% of the NPPV found on the farmland in our study area is likely susceptible to conversion to expanding agricultural production or urban development. Scenario analysis showed planting hedgerows along all farm parcel boundaries and riparian buffers along all farmscape waterways will not compensate for the loss of multifunctionality from agricultural intensification based on expansion. Conserving or planting hedgerows alone however resulted in a disproportionate increase in connectivity given the relative loss of productive agricultural land. This analysis clearly highlights the potential trade-offs among the indicators evaluated as well as the benefits of intensification on land already in production. In the assessed landscape, protecting existing large patches of NPPV and augmenting the landscape pattern with hedgerows is an effective approach to conflicting objectives and ensuring landscape multifunctionality.","APR",2019

Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with Delta AIC(c) < 2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40%. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.","FEB",2009

Dung beetles are a highly used focal taxon for assessing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances and management practices on biodiversity. In the Lacandona rainforest region in southern Mexico, we quantified several metrics of the dung beetle community (number of species, number of individuals, total biomass, mean beetle size) and four of their ecological functions (dung removal, soil excavation, seed dispersal, seed exhumation) in conserved rainforest and three agroforestry systems with different management intensities: rustic cocoa, polyculture cocoa, and rubber monoculture. We also assessed the correlation between dung removal and the other functions, as well as the relationships between functions and community metrics. Land-use type affected the dung beetle communities as well as their functions, with negative effects on response variables in the most intensely managed agroecosystems (polyculture cocoa and rubber). Rustic cocoa had values similar to those of the conserved forest for all functions and community metrics, except the mean number of species per trap. Dung removal was correlated with the other ecological functions. The mean number of species per trap was significantly associated with all four functions. In our study region rustic cocoa plantations favor the maintenance of a high proportion of dung beetle species and maintain their ecological functions. Our findings corroborate that agroecosystems with less intense management may contribute to buffering the effects of landscape homogenization caused by more intensely managed agroecosystems, such as rubber plantations.","JUL",2018

We asked whether unionid mussels influence the distribution and abundance of co-occurring benthic algae and invertebrates. In a yearlong field enclosure experiment in a south-central U.S. river, we examined the effects of living mussels versus sham mussels (shells filled with sand) on periphyton and invertebrates in both the surrounding sediment and on mussel shells. We also examined differences between two common unionid species, Actinonaias ligamentina (Lamarck 1819) and Amblema plicata (Say 1817). 2. Organic matter concentrations and invertebrate densities in the sediment surrounding mussels were significantly higher in treatments with live mussels than treatments with sham mussels or sediment alone. Organic matter was significantly higher in the sediment surrounding Actinonaias than that surrounding Amblema. Actinonaias was more active than Amblema and may have increased benthic organic matter through bioturbation. 3. Living mussels increased the abundance of periphyton on shells and the abundance and richness of invertebrates on shells, whereas effects of sham mussels were similar to sediment alone. Differences in the amount of periphyton growing on the shells of the two mussel species reflected differences in mussel activity and shell morphology. 4. Differences between living and sham mussel treatments indicate that biological activities of mussels provide ecosystem services to the benthic community beyond the physical habitat provided by shells alone. In treatments containing live mussels we found significant correlations between organic matter and chlorophyll a concentrations in the sediment, organic matter concentrations and invertebrate abundance in the sediment and the amount of chlorophyll a on the sediment and invertebrate abundance. There were no significant correlations among these response variables in control treatments. Thus, in addition to providing biogenic structure as habitat, mussels likely facilitate benthic invertebrates by altering the availability of resources (algae and organic matter) through nutrient excretion and biodeposition. 5. Effects of mussels on sediment and shell periphyton concentrations, organic matter concentrations and invertebrate abundance, varied seasonally, and were strongest in late summer during periods of low water volume, low flow, and high water temperature. 6. Our study demonstrates that freshwater mussels can strongly influence the co-occurring benthic community, but that effects of mussels are context-dependent and may vary among species.","JUN",2006

We compiled data on 699 sites with publicly funded stream restoration and management projects completed in the past 30 years and the biophysical and sociopolitical characteristics of the 310 sub-catchments in our study area.

Both ecological and human-oriented restoration efforts were clustered near the coastline. Stream activities of all kinds were highest in sub-catchments with water quality impairment, high population density, high pro-environmental voting, and a highly educated, wealthy, non-Hispanic white population. Ecological restoration and data collection were also greater in catchments with higher native fish richness.

While farm management is a key factor for ES provision, farmers may widely differ in their awareness, ambition and skills to manage their systems. Currently there is a lack of understanding of farmers' perception on ES, and how this is related to their management. We studied the management and perception of large scale farmers, conventional family farmers and agroecological family farmers in the Zona de Mata region in Brazil. Farmers were interviewed and constructed fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) of their perception on ES. The FCM analysis revealed that in general, the perception of farmers on ES is highly complex and interconnected. Yet, agroecological family farmers showed a more complex perception on ES, which is associated with more diversified and autonomous agroecosystems. Both agroecological and conventional family farmers had a strong peasant identity, recognising more cultural ecosystem services than large scale farmers and relied more on production for consumption. Initiatives that aim to strengthen on-farm ecosystem services provision should be sensitive to farmer's perceptions and may need to consider using specific strategies for different farmer types.","OCT",2018

Dehesa, oak woodlands managed for grazing, cropping, and other forms of production, is the most common rangeland system and one of the most distinctive landscapes. Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity management that enhances a wide range of ecosystem services, current management has shifted from the traditional toward more intensified models. This paper assesses the coproduction of ecosystem services on dehesa properties by exploring the relationship between biophysical and sociocultural factors and dehesa management practices. Based on 42 surveys we analyze 16 quantitative indicators using multivariate techniques. The results indicate that there are four main dehesa types as defined by their characteristics and management: large heterogeneous operations with diverse products; small and homogeneous operations focused on a reduced number of products; medium-large properties focused on crop production; and midsized properties with easy public access. Management is the result of the dynamics of interacting biophysical and sociocultural factors that influence manager priorities and investment. Management decisions group around the degree of multifunctionality of the operation, the relative importance of crop production, the degree of grazing pressure in the system, and how restrictive public access policy is. We find that in the study area interactions between all the previously mentioned elements covary consistently. generating bundles of ecosystem services associated with each of three management models based on the intensity of management.

This ongoing process of land degradation asks for effective strategies of soil protection. In this context, it is important to understand processes that build up and regenerate soil. The present study investigated how the soil ecosystem, including soil organisms, vegetation and soil ecological processes, develops during the process of soil formation in a chronosequence in a glacier forefield in Iceland. We hypothesised that along successional age we see increases in nutrient content, vegetation cover, and plant species richness linked to increases in soil food webs biomass and complexity. In line with our expectations all measured pools of carbon and nitrogen, and vegetation cover increased with age in the glacial forefield, but plant species richness levelled off after 30 years. Soil organisms generally increased in biomass with successional age, although some of the groups of soil organisms peaked at an intermediate successional stage. In contrast to our expectations, some of the calculated food web complexity metrics such as the number of trophic groups and trophic chain length did not increase linearly, but showed an intermediate peak or even decreased with successional age. However, plant cover and pools of carbon and nitrogen still increased after 120 years. From these results we conclude that soil ecosystem development takes more than a century under Icelandic climatic conditions to fully develop in terms of vegetation succession, food web structure and biogeochemical cycling.","SEP",2018

As much as every modern human society depends on a network of settlements that is well-connected by transport infrastructure (i.e., settlement network), animal and plant species depend on networks of habitats between which they can move (i.e., habitat networks). However, changes to a settlement network in a region often threaten the integrity of the region's habitat networks. Determining plans and policy to prevent these threats is made difficult by the numerous interactions and feedbacks that exist between and within the settlement and habitat networks. Mathematical models of coupled settlement and habitat networks can help us understand the dynamics of this social-ecological system. Yet, few attempts have been made to develop such mathematical models. In this paper, we promote the development of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. First, we present a conceptual framework of key variables that are ideally considered when operationalizing the coupling of settlement and habitat networks. In this framework, we first describe important network-internal interactions by differentiating between the structural (i.e., relating to purely physical conditions determining the suitability of a location for living or movement) and functional (i.e., relating to the actual presence, abundance or movement of people or other organisms) properties of either network. We then describe the main one-way influences that a settlement network can exert on the habitat networks and vice versa. Second, we give several recommendations for the mathematical modeling of coupled settlement and habitat networks and present several existing modeling approaches (e.g., habitat network models and land-use transport interaction models) that could be used for this purpose. Lastly, we elaborate on potential applications of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks in the development of complex network theory, in the assessment of system resilience and in conservation, transport and urban planning. The development of coupled settlement and habitat network models is important to gain a better system-level understanding of biodiversity conservation under a rapidly urbanizing and growing human population.","43571",2018

In multitrophic communities diversity may vary at different trophic levels, with either synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecosystem functioning. Intensification of land-use systems is often found to reduce diversity, which in turn may lead to reduced associated ecological functions in natural food webs, such as host-parasite interactions. In this study we investigated the relationship between the number of natural enemy and host species and the mean rate and temporal variability of parasitism (inverse of stability), along an intensification gradient of coffee agroforests in Ecuador. We used standardised trap nests for bees and wasps and their natural enemies in 14 agroforests, and evaluated these monthly over a period of 17 months. We found that parasitism rates of wasps and bees increased with increasing number of enemy species and decreased with increasing number of host species. Temporal variability in parasitism rates decreased with increasing number of enemy species and increased with temporal variability in enemy species richness; however, these effects were restricted to wasp hosts. Intensification of agroforests did not significantly affect species richness of hosts or enemies or their relation to parasitism and its temporal variability. We conclude that high enemy diversity may enhance parasitism rates and that high host diversity may provide resistance against consumption. Furthermore, we show that a diverse and stable enemy community may also have a stabilizing effect on parasitism rates. However, these effects may be host-guild specific, as these relations were restricted to wasps.","MAR",2010

We assessed the impact of lake trout on a key piscivore, the river otter (Lontra canadensis) in two lakes in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake continues to support a native cutthroat trout population, although the recent introduction of lake trout has dramatically impacted the cutthroat trout population. Nearby Lewis Lake has an entirely introduced fish fauna of lake trout, brown trout (Salmo trutta), and Utah chub (Gilia atraria) but lacks cutthroat trout. Analysis of otter scat from Yellowstone Lake implicated trout (lake or cutthroat trout) as a major prey item (57% of scat), whereas stable isotopes identified longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) as the primary prey there (58% of diet). By contrast, scat from Lewis Lake implicated minnows, presumably Utah chub, as the primary prey for otters occupying that lake (86%), while stable isotopes implicated brown trout (64%) over both lake trout and Utah chub (36% combined). Our data establish the importance of alternative prey to otters and suggest that lake trout-induced reductions in cutthroat trout may not be catastrophic for otter populations here. These data do not necessarily exonerate lake trout, as their impact on other species, most notably grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and piscivorous birds, has been documented to be substantial, and further data on the nutritional value of alternate prey are required to confirm or refute a working hypothesis that otter populations will continue to thrive in the face of the lake trout invasion.

Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of 'stabilizing mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate along three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly 'redundant' species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.","43487",2009

Large-scale ecological restoration projects have been implemented around China with the goal of restoring and sustaining ecosystem services, especially in vulnerable semi-arid regions where soil and water resources are most stressed due to historic human activities. The relationships among ecosystem services are often driven by land-use changes. It is necessary to develop an applicable method to explore the relationships between ecosystem services and driving factors over time. We selected the Yanhe Basin on China's Loess Plateau as the study area, which has experienced a large-scale Grain for Green Project (GGP), and quantified four ecosystem services (soil conservation, water retention, water yield, and crop production). The results of this study show that different trends have occurred for ecosystem services during 2000-2008. We found potential tradeoffs between soil conservation and water yield. Synergies may exist among water retention and soil conservation/water yield. Two types of preconditions were pointed out in the analysis process to define the potential relationships among ecosystem service variables. The correspondence analysis was used to explore its intrinsic linkage and its variations among ecosystemservices, land uses, and spatial locations. It suggests that the intensities of the ecosystem services provided by most of land uses and the internal proportion of regulating service to provision service in a sub-basin has been changed by GGP, but the relative spatial patterns of ecosystem services are still being maintained in entire basin scale from 1980 to 2008.","DEC",2014

Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies, i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral, profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types. The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic conditions are not accounted for.

We combined airborne imaging spectrometer and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) observations with field measurements to assess if the highly invasive nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya alters canopy 3-D structure and aboveground biomass (AGB) along a 1,500 mm precipitation gradient in Hawaii. Airborne analysis of canopy water content, leaf nitrogen concentration, fractional canopy cover, and vegetation height facilitated mapping of native- and Morella-dominated canopies in rainforest, woodland-savanna and shrubland ecosystems, with Morella detection errors ranging from 0 to 13.4%. Allometric equations were developed to relate the combined LiDAR and spectral data to field-based AGB estimates (r (2) = 0.97, P < 0.01), and to produce a map of biomass stocks throughout native and invaded ecosystems. The structure of the invasive Morella canopies varied by ecosystem type, and the invader shaded out native understory plants in rainforest zones. Despite a 350% increase in AGB going from shrubland to rainforest, Morella did not increase average AGB in any ecosystem it invaded. Furthermore, spatial distributions of biomass indicated that Morella decreased maximum AGB in the woodland-savanna ecosystems. We conclude that Morella tree invasion does not enhance aboveground carbon stocks in any ecosystem it invades in Hawaii, thereby minimizing its contribution to this potentially important ecosystem service. We also found that the fusion of spectral and LiDAR remote sensing provided canopy chemical and structural data facilitating a landscape assessment of how biological invasion alters on carbon stocks and other ecosystem properties.","MAR",2010

Population increases of native herbivores, e.g. white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), combined with burgeoning plant invasions raise concerns for native plant diversity and forest regeneration. While individual researchers typically test for the impact of deer on plant invasion at a few sites, the overarching influence of deer on plant invasion across regional scales is unclear. We tested the effects of deer on the abundance and diversity of introduced and native herbaceous and woody plants across 23 white-tailed deer research sites distributed across the east-central and north-eastern USA and representing a wide range of deer densities and invasive plant abundance and identity. Deer access/exclusion or deer population density did not affect introduced plant richness or community-level abundance. Native and total plant species richness, abundance (cover and stem density) and Shannon diversity were lower in deer-access vs. deer-exclusion plots. Among deer-access plots, native species richness, native and total cover, and Shannon diversity (cover) declined as deer density increased. Deer access increased the proportion of introduced species cover (but not of species richness or stem density). As deer density increased, the proportion of introduced species richness, cover and stem density all increased. Because absolute abundance of introduced plants was unaffected by deer, the increase in proportion of introduced plant abundance is likely an indirect effect of deer reducing native cover. Indicator species analysis revealed that deer access favoured three introduced plant species, including Alliaria petiolata and Microstegium vimineum, as well as four native plant species. In contrast, deer exclusion favoured three introduced plant species, including Lonicera japonica and Rosa multiflora, and 15 native plant species. Overall, native deer reduced community diversity, lowering native plant richness and abundance, and benefited certain invasive plants, suggesting pervasive impacts of this keystone herbivore on plant community composition and ecosystem services in native forests across broad swathes of the eastern USA.","FEB",2018

However, restorations often have lower diversity than remnant, reference sites. Phylogenetic diversity is an important component of biodiversity and ecosystem function that has only recently been used to evaluate restoration outcomes. To move towards prediction in the restoration of biodiversity, it is necessary to understand how phylogenetic diversity of restorations compares with that of reference sites, and where deficits are found, to evaluate factors constraining phylogenetic diversity. We quantified plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in eastern tallgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems on earth. We measured diversity at large (site) and small (plot) scales in 19 restored prairies and compared patterns with those from 41 remnant prairies. To evaluate how environmental conditions and management actions influence outcomes, we tested the effects of soil properties and seed mix composition on diversity of restorations. Restored prairies were less phylogenetically diverse than remnants at both spatial scales. On the other hand, the total species richness of remnant and restored prairies did not significantly differ, but remnants had higher native richness. Restored communities were taxonomically and phylogenetically distinct from remnants. Soil properties (moisture and pH) influenced phylogenetic diversity and composition. There were positive relationships between the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of seed mixes and resulting diversity of planted assemblages (excluding volunteer species). Species in seed mixes were more closely related than expected by chance, and several clades found in remnant prairies were missing from seed mixes. Synthesis and applications. Restored tallgrass prairies had lower phylogenetic diversity than remnant prairies, which may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon of restorations not being functionally equivalent to reference sites. It is encouraging for restoration efforts that seed mix phylogenetic diversity predicted phylogenetic diversity of planted assemblages. This indicates that designing phylogenetically diverse seed mixes for restoration is beneficial. In addition, clades found in reference sites that are missing from restoration seed mixes could be added to new or existing restorations to reduce gaps in phylogenetic diversity.

However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.",NA,2018

Ecological restoration is an approach to mitigate these impacts. However, little is known about how animal communities and plant-animal interactions respond to the combined effects of land-use legacies and restoration. We investigated how restoration and agricultural history affect bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) communities and pollination function. In 27 paired remnant (no history of agriculture) and post-agricultural longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) woodlands, we established 4-10 1-ha plots (126 total) and experimentally restored half of them, while the other half were left as unrestored controls. Restoration was accomplished through canopy thinning which reinstates open savanna-like conditions. We collected bees in each plot using a combination of bowl trapping and standardized netting transects. Thinning increased bee abundance by 169% and bee richness by 110%, but agricultural land use had no effect on these variables. Bee community composition was affected by restoration and was marginally affected by agricultural history. To measure pollination function, we conducted a sentinel plant experiment in which potted black mustard (Brassica nigra L.) plants were placed out in a subset of these sites (n = 10) and either bagged to exclude pollinators or left open for pollinator access. Then, we measured fruit and seed set of sentinel plants to compare pollination function among the restoration and land-use history treatments. Seed set and fruit set of sentinel plants were higher in open than bagged plants, indicating that this model system effectively measured pollination, but we found no differences in pollination based on restoration or agricultural history. These results indicate that although pollinator communities may show clear responses to restoration that are largely independent of prior land-use impacts, this does not necessarily translate into differences in pollination function after restoration.","SEP",2018

Ski-run creation always results in some level of disturbance, but disturbance intensity varies greatly with construction method. Ski runs may be established either by clearing (cutting and removing tall vegetation) or by clearing and then machine-grading (leveling the soil surface with heavy equipment). To quantify how these different intensities of initial disturbance affect ecosystem properties, we extensively surveyed vegetation, soils, and environmental characteristics on cleared ski runs, graded ski runs, and adjacent reference forests across seven large downhill ski resorts in the northern Sierra Nevada, USA. We found that the greater disturbance intensity associated with grading resulted in greater impacts on all ecosystem properties considered, including plant community composition and diversity, soil characteristics relating to processes of nutrient cycling and retention, and measures of erosion potential. We also found that cleared ski runs retained many ecological similarities to reference forests and might even offer some added benefits by possessing greater plant species and functional diversity than either forests or graded runs. Because grading is more damaging to multiple indicators of ecosystem function, clearing rather than grading should be used to create ski slopes wherever practical.","DEC",2009

The objective of our study was to compare ecosystem properties at the aboveground-belowground interface of three land-cover types commonly found in residential landscapes: lawns, bark mulch, and gravel mulch. Using unmowed vegetation as a reference land cover, we measured surface soil variables (to 5 cm depth), CO2 fluxes, and ground temperatures in experimental field plots within 3 years after their creation. Each land cover had a distinctive set of ecosystem properties. Mulched plots had significantly warmer soil and surface temperatures, wetter soils and faster surface litter decomposition than vegetated plots. Variables associated with soil C and earthworm numbers were consistently lowest in gravel-covered soils, whereas bark mulch plots had highest earthworm abundances, lowest soil bulk density, and temporally variable soil organic matter dynamics. Compared to unmowed plots, lawns had higher soil carbon, CO2 fluxes, and temperatures but lower earthworm abundances especially during 2005 drought conditions. We conclude that ecosystem properties of the land covers were influenced by the composition, density, and arrangement of materials comprising their aboveground habitat structures. We discuss our results within an ecosystem services framework and suggest that interpretations of our findings depend on in situ urban environmental contexts and landscape management objectives. Future studies of urban land covers, their ecosystem properties and associated ecosystem services are needed to help provide a scientific basis for sustainable urban landscape management.","NOV",2008

Here, we report structural dynamics and carbon storage gains from mangrove sites that have undergone rehabilitation to ascertain whether reforestation can complement conservation activities and warrant project investment. Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems. They share a similar management history of clearing and conversion for aquaculture before restorative activities were undertaken using the practice of Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR). Species diversity and mean biomass carbon storage gains after 10 yr of regrowth from the high productivity sites of Tiwoho (49.2 +/- 9.1 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) are already almost of one-third of mean biomass stocks exhibited by mature forests (167.8 +/- 30.3 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offset all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11 yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). These findings highlight the importance of geomorphic and biophysical site selection if the primary purpose of EMR is intended to maximize carbon sequestration gains.","JAN",2019

Sudden large disturbances (e.g., typhoons and earthquakes) can have a significant and immediate impact on landscapes and ecosystem services. This study explored how precipitation variation (PV) and land use/land cover (LULC) changes caused by multiple disturbances can cumulatively impact ecosystem functioning in the Chenyulan watershed in central Taiwan. We simulated four ecosystem services (water yield production, water purification, soil conservation, carbon storage) and biodiversity using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and obtain information regarding changes in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that the Chi-Chi earthquake had the greatest impact on the ecosystem. Specifically, the ecosystem was altered by the earthquake and could no longer absorb disturbances of a similar magnitude as before the earthquake. By differentiating the impacts of the PV and LULC changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity, we observe that the PV had a stronger impact on water yield and soil conservation, whereas the LULC change had a stronger impact on water purification. Our results also suggest that a comprehensive ecosystem management plan should consider the cumulative and hierarchical context of disturbance regimes to prevent reductions in ecological variability and ecosystem resilience, particularly in areas that are more sensitive to large disturbances. In this way, ecosystem resilience may be maintained at a level sufficient to preserve ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services in the event of unexpected large-scale environmental disturbances.

We studied aphid settling on barley plants exposed to volatiles from different cultivars, aphid population development in monocultures and two-cultivar mixtures, and differences in volatile composition between studied cultivars. Aphid responses to one cultivar in a mixture were neighbor-specific and this was more important for pest suppression than the overall mixture effect, aphid colonization patterns, or natural enemy abundance. Aphid populations decreased most in a mixture where both cultivars showed a reduced aphid-plant acceptance after reciprocal volatile exposure in the laboratory, and reduced population growth compared to monocultures in the field. Our findings suggest that herbivore population responses to crop genotypic diversity can depend on plant-plant volatile interactions, which can lead to changes in herbivore response to individual cultivars in a mixture, resulting in slower population growth. The impact of plant-plant interaction through volatiles on associated herbivore species is rarely considered, but improved understanding of these mechanisms would advance our understanding of the ecological consequences of biodiversity and guide development of sustainable agricultural practices. Combining cultivars in mixtures based on how they interact with each other is a promising strategy for sustainable pest management.","DEC",2018

With the global population increasingly residing in cities, the relevance of urbanisation, local population and discrete types of green space provision on measures of health, remains a research imperative. To explore this complexity, a series of regression models were employed to quantify the mitigation of local health deprivation by green space and domestic gardens, across a four-stage rural-urban gradient, controlling for household income and local population. The population-standardised quantification of green space provision offered greater interpretive power than did a simple measure of land cover density. Domestic gardens, of the two green land-cover types, provided the most convincing mitigating effect on health deprivation. The findings call for increased acknowledgement of urban gardens in local health promotion, and a closer consideration of local population in planning green space provision and management.

A growing number of studies suggest that intraspecific plant diversity may also enhance the abundance and diversity of wild species and thereby some ecosystem services such as biological control by natural predators. However, positive effects of the genetic diversity of plant species on the diversity of associated communities have mostly been documented in natural systems, with only a handful of studies targeting crop species in agroecosystems. Here, we investigated the ecological effects of the number of winter wheat varieties (Triticum aestivum) on aboveground arthropods and particularly predatory species. We manipulated the number of wheat varieties (1, 2,4 or 8) in 120 plots (80 m(2) each) to examine how wheat diversity and stand characteristics impact communities of three dominant aboveground arthropod groups that include many predatory species: ground beetles, rove beetles and spiders. The number of wheat varieties had a weak, but positive effect on predator abundance, notably spider abundance. In contrast, wheat functional diversity, as assessed by the number of wheat functional groups, was only negatively related to the diversity of spiders. Among wheat stand characteristics, the variance in plant height, wheat biomass and the Green Area Index were weakly correlated with ground beetle, rove beetle and predatory diversity, respectively. The Green Area Index was also weakly correlated with ground beetle abundance. Our study suggests that wheat variety mixtures have variable and limited effects on aboveground arthropods and probably low effectiveness to enhance biological control, but these results should be further tested under low-input agriculture in real fields.

We describe a field study and pollinator exclusion experiments conducted on two soft-fruit crops in a system with both wild and managed pollinators. We test whether fruit quality and quantity is limited by pollination, and whether different pollinating insects respond differently to varying weather conditions. Both strawberries and raspberries produced fewer marketable fruits when insects were excluded, demonstrating dependence on insect pollinators. Raspberries had a short flowering season which coincided with peak abundance of bees, and attracted many bees per flower. In contrast, strawberries had a much longer flowering season and appeared to be much less attractive to pollinators, so that ensuring adequate pollination is likely to be more challenging. The proportion of high-quality strawberries was positively related to pollinator abundance, suggesting that yield was limited by inadequate pollination on some farms. The relative abundance of different pollinator taxa visiting strawberries changed markedly through the season, demonstrating seasonal complementarity. Insect visitors responded differently to changing weather conditions suggesting that diversity can reduce the risk of pollination service shortfalls. For example, flies visited the crop flowers in poor weather and at the end of the flowering season when other pollinators were scarce, and so may provide a unique functional contribution. Understanding how differences between pollinator groups can enhance pollination services to crops strengthens the case for multiple species management. We provide evidence for the link between increased diversity and function in real crop systems, highlighting the risks of replacing all pollinators with managed alternatives.

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.","NOV",2013

In this study, we investigated the responses of major soil biological traits to both the short- and long-term effects of pesticide inputs in golf turfgrass. Overall, golf course fairways receiving regular, high-rate pesticide inputs exhibited suppression in soil biological traits involved in litter decomposition/nutrient mineralization (decomposer arthropod abundance and acid phosphatase activity), and plant nutrient uptake/plant protection (mycorrhizal fungi). In contrast, most beneficial soil biota appeared to tolerate a low level of pesticide input. In a short-term manipulative experiment we observed that monthly applications of chlorothalonil and a single application of imidacloprid, both at a medium label rate, consistently suppressed decomposer microarthropods over a 4-month period. The imidacloprid application also reduced the total infection of mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes in roots. These results suggest that the use of pesticides as a whole does not always result in negative impacts on soil biota, but rather that the pesticide effects vary among functional groups of soil biota and are contingent upon long-term patterns of pesticide input intensity, and short-term differences in active ingredient and application program (application rate and frequency).

For centuries, low-intensity management in these landscapes has resulted in multiple microhabitats that favour biodiversity and are considered key elements for the long-term persistence of wood-pastures. However, the relative contribution of each microhabitat type to wood-pasture biodiversity and functioning remains poorly studied. We investigated the impact that different wood-pasture microhabitats have on soil chemical fertility and the decomposition food web. We analysed the two main microhabitats that make wood-pastures up - open grasslands and isolated trees and three additional ""litter-trapping"" microhabitats - shrubs scattered in the grassland matrix, canopied shrubs and piles of pruning debris in terms of soil chemical properties (organic matter content, total N, C:N ratio, available P, and exchangeable base cations), collembolan and dipteran (mostly detritivores) abundance, and carabid (seed-eaters and predators) and staphylinid (mostly predators) beetle abundance, body size, biomass, species richness and composition. Grasslands were the most different microhabitats, with the lowest soil nutrient content and particular carabid and staphylinid species composition. Trees had the highest soil fertility levels and abundance of Diptera and staphylinids, and held unique staphylinid assemblages. ""Litter-trapping"" microhabitats had medium to high soil nutrient values and shared a distinct staphylinid assemblage compared to grasslands and trees. Besides, scattered shrubs provided shelter for large-sized carabid and staphylinid predators, while canopied shrubs held the highest carabid abundance and biomass. ""Litter-trapping"" microhabitats retained tree leaves that would otherwise be lost to the wood-pasture, recovering nutrients to the system, and provided new habitat, shelter and food for detritivores and unique predator assemblages. ""Litter-trapping"" microhabitats thus enhanced soil fertility and the decomposition process, at the same time as increased the abundance and diversity of the communities of ground-dwelling detritivores and predators inhabiting wood-pastures. These findings confirmed that microhabitat heterogeneity resulting from low-intensity management is essential to maintain both the primary production and the biodiversity conservation value of wood pastures.

Ocean acidification (OA) threatens calcifying organisms such as the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. In contrast, seagrasses, such as the eelgrass Zostera marina, can benefit from the increase in available carbon for photosynthesis found at a lower seawater pH. Seagrasses can remove dissolved inorganic carbon from OA environments, creating local daytime pH refugia. Pacific oysters may improve the health of eelgrass by filtering out pathogens such as Labyrinthula zosterae (LZ), which causes eelgrass wasting disease (EWD). We examined how co-culture of eelgrass ramets and juvenile oysters affected the health and growth of eelgrass and the mass of oysters under different pCO(2) exposures. In Phase I, each species was cultured alone or in co-culture at 12 degrees C across ambient, medium, and high pCO(2) conditions, (656, 1,158 and 1,606 mu atm pCO(2), respectively). Under high pCO(2), eelgrass grew faster and had less severe EWD (contracted in the field prior to the experiment). Co-culture with oysters also reduced the severity of EWD. While the presence of eelgrass decreased daytime pCO(2), this reduction was not substantial enough to ameliorate the negative impact of high pCO(2) on oyster mass. In Phase II, eelgrass alone or oysters and eelgrass in co-culture were held at 15 degrees C under ambient and high pCO(2) conditions, (488 and 2,013atm pCO(2), respectively). Half of the replicates were challenged with cultured LZ. Concentrations of defensive compounds in eelgrass (total phenolics and tannins), were altered by LZ exposure and pCO(2) treatments. Greater pathogen loads and increased EWD severity were detected in LZ exposed eelgrass ramets; EWD severity was reduced at high relative to low pCO(2). Oyster presence did not influence pathogen load or EWD severity; high LZ concentrations in experimental treatments may have masked the effect of this treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that, when exposed to natural concentrations of LZ under high pCO(2) conditions, eelgrass can benefit from co-culture with oysters. Further experimentation is necessary to quantify how oysters may benefit from co-culture with eelgrass, examine these interactions in the field and quantify context-dependency.","AUG",2018

Based on the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, multiple ecosystem services including water supply, sediment retention, carbon storage and habitat quality in the Guizhou Province of southwest China were assessed and mapped at the watershed scale in this study. The correlation among multiple ecosystem services was investigated and effects of the ecological condition and human pressure on ecosystem services explored. Results indicated obvious spatial heterogeneity in multiple ecosystem services and ecosystem services bundling; 51.09% of the area was designated at a moderate-level for ""hotspot"" (high ecosystem services provision) area. Tradeoffs existed between water supply and sediment retention and also between carbon storage and sediment retention. The spatial pattern of water supply in Guizhou was heavily affected by precipitation, evaporation and root depth associated with each land use type, while the rainfall erosivity, topography, cover-management factor and support practice associated with land use types played important roles in spatial distribution of sediment retention. The area and proportion of forestland were considered to be dominant factors affecting carbon storage. Habitat suitability of natural land use and the weight and effect distance of human land use were key driving factors affecting the habitat quality score and its spatial pattern. A weak negative correlation was demonstrated between human pressure indicators including the urbanization rate, GDP per person and population density and ecosystem services.","JUL",2017

A.","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","Riparian zones along streams and other small wetlands perform important ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. They improve water quality by retaining nutrients and sediment from through-flowing water, sequester carbon and attenuate flood peaks at high discharge. At the same time, they have been shown to enhance biodiversity at the landscape as well as regional scale. However, there is concern about loss of biodiversity and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions where wetlands have become overloaded with nutrient-rich surface water or groundwater. This paper discusses conditions for the best performance of riparian zones and other small wetlands in agricultural landscapes in terms of nutrient and greenhouse gas retention and biodiversity. High nitrous oxide emissions have been identified in riparian zones used for N removal and could be a concern which would diminish their overall environmental benefit. However, it has been shown in riparian zones in the Rhine and Scheldt catchment that nitrous oxide emissions mainly occur when soil pH values are lower than 5. Such conditions occur mostly in stream headwater areas only where sandy sediments have a low buffering capacity, whereas higher-order streams and their riparian zones often have fine silty clay or loam sediments with higher pH values, supporting effective denitrification with low nitrous oxide emission. The question whether the nutrient attenuation service comes at the expense of biodiversity losses should be answered differently for existing, (semi-)natural wetlands and for new wetlands created in the agricultural landscape. Existing wetlands are quite vulnerable for nutrient loading, depending on their natural nutrient richness. Oligotrophic and mesotrophic wetlands such as bogs and fens are negatively affected by nutrient loadings > 4 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 0.5 g P m(-2) y(-1), which lead to loss of diversity and characteristic species. Wetlands in riparian zones are naturally more nutrient-rich and can tolerate much higher nutrient loadings without consequences for ecosystem health and diversity, their loading limits are 50 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4 g P m(-2) y(-1). For nitrogen the relatively high limit is explained by significant denitrification activities in wetlands, transforming nitrate to mostly inert elemental nitrogen gas. There are also indications that only one of the major nutrients needs to be in short supply (i.e. below the limits indicated) in order to avoid major eutrophication problems. In agricultural areas where large numbers of wetlands have been created for N removal and biodiversity enhancement, the experience of this 'dual purpose' are generally positive, particularly in landscapes where not much of the original wetland resource remains.

The importance of this endeavor prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to evaluate their sun-to-shade coffee restoration program in Puerto Rico initiated in 2003. We quantified the responses of 12 resident avian species using estimates of local occupancy and extinction probabilities based on surveys conducted in 2015-2017 at 65 restored farms grouped according to time-since-initial-restoration (TSIR): new (2011-2014), intermediate (2007-2010), and old (2003-2006). We also surveyed 40 forest sites, which served as reference sites. Vegetation complexity increased with TSIR, ranging between 35 and 40% forest cover in farms 6-9 years TSIR. Forest specialists (e.g. Loxigilla portoricencis) exhibited highest average occupancy in farms initially classified as intermediate (6-9 years) and old (>10 years), paralleling occupancy in secondary forests. Occupancy of open-habitat specialists (e.g. Tiaris olivaceus) was more variable, but higher in recently restored farms. Restoring the shade layer has the potential to heighten ecological services derived from forest specialists (e.g. frugivores) without losing the services of many open-habitat specialists (e.g. insectivores). Annual local extinction probability for forest specialists decreased with increasing habitat complexity, strengthening the potential value of shade restoration as a tool to enhance habitat for avifauna that evolved in forested landscapes.","NOV",2018

Fish biodiversity assessment was conducted in the headwater tributaries of the glacial-fed Tamor River and rain-fed Kamala River in eastern Nepal. A total of eight sites were sampled. pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and temperature were estimated using multi-meter field probe. Standard electrofishing was conducted for fish sampling with two rounds of fishing for 20 min each at site. Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) was calculated for each sample and the samples were identified in the field itself following standard literature. Unidentified samples were brought to the laboratory for further identification. Descriptive statistics was performed; Species richness, Shannon Weiner Diversity and Simpson's Diversity Index were estimated. One way ANOVA and an independent t test were performed respectively to look at the variation in fish abundance between seasons and between the tributaries of the Tamor River and the Kamala River. Threat status categories of the fish species was compared with those of IUCN. pH was neutral to alkaline in both the types of streams. Significant variation (p = 0.01) in seasons as well as between two types of headwater tributaries were observed in pH, temperature and conductivity. Temperature and conductivity were significantly higher in the rain-fed tributaries. These parameters were significantly higher during the pre-monsoon and lowest during the winter in both types of streams. A total of 8940 fishes belonging to four orders, 10 families, 26 genera and 34 species were enumerated. Significant variation in Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index (p = 0.015) and Species Richness (p = 0.005) between the glacial fed and rain fed streams with higher values of these indices in the rain fed tributaries. Fish abundance also varied significantly (p = 0.02) between seasons in the Tamor's tributaries with higher abundance in the pre-monsoon and lowest during the winter. Cypriniformes was the most dominant taxa with Schistura beavani (26.14), Barilius vagra (8.46) and Garra gotyla gotyla (7.63). Schizothorax richardsonii (10.31) and Schistura beavani (47.19) were the most dominant species in the Kamala's and the Tamor's tributaries. These findings indicate that fish assemblages reflect the different ecological regimes of the glacial-fed and rain-fed headwaters. The findings of this study contribute to the knowledge of fish diversity and also compliment the threat status of the IUCN fish data. Replication of similar studies encompassing temporal and spatial scales is necessary for the development pf effective conservation strategies.","AUG",2018

The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000-2012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000-2012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems.

Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal - the ""flying"" collembolans - and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.","FEB",2018

Over the past decade, several foodborne disease outbreaks provoked widespread reforms to the fresh produce industry. Subsequent concerns about wildlife vectors and contaminated manures created pressure on growers to discontinue use of manure-based composts and remove nearby semi-natural vegetation. Despite widespread adoption, impacts of these practices on ecosystem services such as pest control have not been assessed. 2. We used a landscape-scale field experiment to quantify associations between compost applications, semi-natural vegetation, pest control services and lettuce yields on organic farms throughout California's Central Coast, a region experiencing food safety reforms. 3. We found that farms with surrounding semi-natural vegetation supported a diverse arthropod assemblage, whereas a herbivore-dominated assemblage occupied farms in simplified landscapes. Moreover, predatory arthropods consumed more herbivores at sites with more surrounding non-crop vegetation and reduced aphid pest infestations in lettuce. 4. Compost improved lettuce yields by increasing soil nutrients and organic matter, but affected neither pest control nor Escherichia coli prevalence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Food safety concerns are prompting practices that simplify farms and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that two practices elimination of manure based composts and removal of non-crop vegetation are likely having negative impacts on arthropod biodiversity, pest control and soil quality. Critically, our findings and previous research suggest that compost can be applied safely and that habitat removal is likely ineffective at mitigating food safety risk. There is thus scope for co-managing fresh produce fields for food safety, ecosystem services, and biodiversity through applying appropriately treated composts and stopping habitat removal.","OCT",2016

We examined how experimental warming and grazing affected species within plant groups of direct importance to Tibetan pastoralists: medicinal plants used by humans and palatable plants consumed by livestock. Warming resulted in species losses from both the medicinal and palatable plant groups; however, differential relative vulnerability to warming occurred. With respect to the percent of warming-induced species losses, the overall plant community lost 27%, medicinal plants lost 21%, and non-medicinal plants lost 40% of species. Losses of palatable and non-palatable species were similar to losses in the overall plant community. The deep-rootedness of medicinal plants resulted in lowered sensitivity to warming, whereas the shallow-rootedness of non-medicinal plants resulted in greater sensitivity to warming; the variable rooting depth of palatable and non-palatable plants resulted in an intermediate response to warming. Predicting the vulnerability of plant groups to human activities can be enhanced by knowledge of plant traits, their response to specific drivers, and their distribution within plant groups. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which a driver operates, and the evolutionary interaction of plants with that driver, will aid predictions. Future steps to protect ecosystem services furnished by medicinal and palatable plants will be required under the novel stress of a warmer climate. Grazing may be an important tool in maintaining some of these services under future warming.","AUG",2008

An understanding of these changes and their consequences in terrestrial ecosystems requires knowledge of the linkage between above- and below-ground components as well as the species interactions found in plant-soil systems, which have important implications for biogeochemical cycles. However, winter climate-change studies have focused on only a part of the ecosystem or ecological process. We summarize here recent findings related to the effects of winter climate and its changes on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions from the soil, N use by individual plants, vegetation development, and interactions between vegetation and pollinators to generate an integrative understanding of the response of the plant-soil system to winter climate change. This review indicates that the net effects on plants, soil microbes, pollinators, and the associated biogeochemical cycles are balanced among several processes and are highly variable depending on the context, such as the target species/functional group, original winter condition of the habitat, and type of climate change. The consequences of winter climate change for species interactions among plants, associated animals, and biogeochemical cycles are largely unknown. For further research, a large-scale comparative study to measure ecosystem-level functions is important, especially in less-cold ecosystems.","JUL",2014

The Sanjiang Plain, an important grain production base in China, is typical of ecosystems, yet its SOC storage and pattern has not been fully investigated because of insufficient soil investigation. In this study, 419 soil samples obtained in 2012 for each of the three soil depth ranges 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm and a geostatistical method are used to estimate the total SOC storage and density (SOCD) of this region. The results give rise to 2.32 Pg C for the SOC storage and 21.20 kgm(-2) for SOCD, which is higher than the mean value for the whole country. The SOCD shows notable changes in lateral and vertical distribution. In addition, vegetation, climate, and soil texture, as well as agricultural activities, are demonstrated to have remarkable impacts on the variation in SOCD of this region. Soil texture has stronger impacts on the distribution of SOCD than climate in the Sanjiang Plain. Specifically, clay content can explain the largest proportion of the SOC variations (21.2% in the top 30 cm) and is the most dominant environmental controlling factor. Additionally, the effects of both climate and soil texture on SOCD show a weakening with increasing soil layer depth. This study indicates that reducing the loss of SOC requires effective conservation and restoration efforts of wetlands and forestlands, as well as sensible fertilization. The results from this study provide the most up-to-date knowledge on the storage and pattern of SOC in the Sanjiang Plain and have important implications for the determination of ecosystem carbon budgets and understanding ecosystem services.",NA,2015

As ephemeral submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), Ruppia maritima has a short well-defined growth-senescence cycle and should benefit from any ecological interaction that enhances its physical condition and longevity. Grass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.) are abundant facultative grazers of epiphytic algae and conveyors of nutrients in tidal marsh and SAV habitats. Grass shrimp addition consistently enhanced Ruppia biomass and shoot density in a series of three field experiments conducted in Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. In two experiments, epiphyte grazing by grass shrimp enhanced Ruppia by inhibiting die-back during the mid- and latter stages of the Ruppia life cycle. Despite a nonsignificant epiphyte grazing effect, grass shrimp also enhanced Ruppia during its early growth stage in a third experiment. In that experiment, nutrient addition also significantly increased epiphyte biomass. Grass shrimp may have fostered the early growth of Ruppia through direct deposition of feces to the sediment in the third experiment. Grass shrimp play a pivotal trophic role in the maintenance of Ruppia through context-dependent interactions involving stage of the SAV life cycle, season, and nutrient limitation.","MAR",2007

Local government decision makers are still unsure of the applicability, return on investment, and usefulness of these assessments in aiding their decision making. Cape Town, a developing city in a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, has numerous competing land uses. City managers, with a tightly constrained budget, requested an exploratory study on the links between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation within this municipal area. We set out to develop and test a simple and rapid ecosystem service assessment method aimed at determining the contribution natural vegetation remnants make to ecosystem service provision. We took selected services, identified in conjunction with city managers, and assessed these in two ways. First we used an area weighted approach to attribute services to vegetation types and assessed how these had changed through time and into the future given development needs. Second, we did a regulatory and cultural service remnant distance analysis to better understand proximity effects and linkages. Provisioning services were found to have been most severely affected through vegetation transformation. Regulatory services have been similarly affected, and these losses are more significant because regulatory services can only function in situ and cannot be outsourced in the way provisioning services can. The most significant losses were in coastal zone protection and flood mitigation services, both of which will be placed under even greater pressure given the predicted changes in climatic regimes. The role of remnant vegetation in regulating and cultural services was shown to be a significant additional consideration in making the case for conservation in the city. Our rapid assessment approach does not allow for nuanced and individual understanding of the trade-offs presented by individual remnant patches, but is particularly strong in quickly identifying issues, key focus areas, and opportunities provided by this research direction, and thereby serving to facilitate and drive constructive engagement between ecosystem service experts and city planners.",NA,2012

Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0-20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxe (N-2 and O-2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management.","SEP",2018

We tested multiple hypotheses regarding environmental and endogenous variables as controlling mechanisms, analyzing time-series mast production data in relation to weather variables (precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, wind) over different time frames, and assessed evidence for weather tracking, resource switching, resource depletion, resource cycling, and pollen limitation. We found that (1) in univariate regression analyses, mast production in all three species was inversely related to lagged late-summer/autumn temperatures during fruit primordia formation (1-yr lag for juniper and oak, 2-yr lag for pinon pine). Juniper mast production (n = 412 trees) was positively related to current-year late-winter (February-April) precipitation, combined with a negative relationship with current-year summer temperatures. Pinon pine mast production (n = 210 trees) was positively related to 1-yr lagged total annual precipitation and negatively associated with current-year spring and summer temperatures. Oak mast production (n = 194 trees) also was positively related to current-year late-winter precipitation but was not affected by subsequent summer temperatures. (2) Multivariate environmental logistic regression models produced reasonable fits to observed field mast values.

Therefore, considering the cultural dimension of ER is a way of increasing public acceptance of restoration projects. In this study, we assessed the public acceptance of a restoration project in a coastal wetland of Costa Brava (Spain). We combined the ES framework with a cultural approach, which is capable of considering interdisciplinarity, introducing barely assessed services like tranquility and facilitating further integration of the human dimension in the ES framework. We administered an open-ended questionnaire to 232 visitors and the answers were submitted to a content analysis to get a post hoc classification of services and values. Our results show that visitors undervalue environmental values, while tranquility is the most commonly stated value. Moreover, place attachment is found to be the main driver to influence the perception of the ER. The study concluded that the project enjoys a high public acceptance. However, some disengagement exists between the goals of restoration and visitors' perceptions, and this needs to be addressed.

However, we still lack understanding about how species composition and diversity affect certain wetland ecosystem functions associated with these ecosystem services. Our objective was to investigate the link between plant community (diversity and composition) and plant carbon storage, root surface area and methane (CH4) emission. We hypothesized that more diverse mixtures would 1) store more carbon in above and belowground biomass and 2) emit less CH4 due to increased root surface area and aeration. Three plant groups that represented different growth forms (i.e., ""functional groups"": ferns, reeds and tussocks) were planted in mesocosms to represent four levels of functional diversity and every combination of functional groups at each diversity level. Unplanted mesocosms served as the zero diversity treatment. At peak biomass in 2014 and 2015, we harvested aboveground biomass and took soil cores from each mesocosm at 0-10 cm to determine the root biomass and surface area. Methane fluxes were measured in situ using a closed chamber system and a Picarro G2301 CRDS analyzer. Fluxes did not vary by functional group richness level or composition. Presence of the reed and tussock functional groups decreased fluxes; however, root surface area was not correlated with CH4 emission. Plant carbon storage was greater in all treatments containing tussocks (expect for the reed tussock mixture) compared with ferns grown alone. Functional group richness did not have a significant effect on plant carbon storage, however there was a positive trend. Root surface area increased 87% from the first to second year; however, there were no differences among functional group richness levels or mixtures. Our results indicate that planting reed and tussock functional groups in dense clumps during restoration could maintain a high level of carbon storage and relatively low CH4 emissions.

Understanding the spatial components of diversity within an agricultural mosaic can help to select the appropriate spatial scale for conserving species and ecological functions such as the provisioning of resources for pollinators. We hypothesize that trait syndromes aimed at provisioning resources for pollinators are positively related to non-crop habitats and negatively related to increasing agricultural intensification. We sampled plant species in 140 patches distributed among seven habitats (abandoned fields, boundaries, roadverges, and edges and inner alfalfa and cereal fields) that were classified into three levels of agricultural intensification: Low, Medium and High. We examined differences in species and functional assemblages, splitting response and effect traits, across various habitats and levels of agricultural intensification. Species richness and functional diversity of response and effect traits were partitioned along spatial scales. Both species and functional assemblages changed across habitats and with different levels of agricultural intensification. Non-cropped habitats and low levels of agricultural intensification promoted trait syndromes with trait-overdispersion mainly linked to the provisioning of resources for pollinators. The species turnover did not imply a functional turnover. Our study shows that traits are determined by agricultural intensification, and no further details on field position and habitat variability are needed to promote vegetation types with trait syndromes able to support pollinating insects.","43539",2018

However, the form of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) and how relationships change with environmental change is poorly understood. This limits our ability to predict the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, particularly in real-world marine ecosystems that are species rich, and where multiple ecosystem functions are represented by multiple indicators. We investigated spatial variation in BEF relationships across a 300 000 m(2) intertidal sandflat by nesting experimental manipulations of sediment pore water nitrogen concentration into sites with contrasting macro-benthic community composition. Our results highlight the significance of many different elements of biodiversity associated with environmental characteristics, community structure, functional diversity, ecological traits or particular species (ecosystem engineers) to important functions of coastal marine sediments (benthic oxygen consumption, ammonium pore water concentrations and flux across the sediment-water interface). Using the BEF relationships developed from our experiment, we demonstrate patchiness across a landscape in functional performance and the potential for changes in the location of functional hot and cold spots with increasing nutrient loading that have important implications for mapping and predicating change in functionality and the concomitant delivery of ecosystem services.","43567",2017

Urban areas benefit from the ecosystem services provided by low input green roofs. However, limited substrate depth on these green roofs creates challenging conditions for plant establishment and survival, leading to industry reliance on non-native succulents. 2. Through a green roof and glasshouse study, we assessed the impact of simple design modifications to the green roof surface, including redistribution of substrate and addition of logs and pebble piles, on both substrate temperature and moisture content. We added seeds of 26 native species and quantified seedling density, species richness and composition over a single growing season. Overall effects of microsite heterogeneity on species diversity were assessed using species accumulation curves. 3. The modifications altered substrate temperature and moisture. Deep substrate (10-12 cm) and the presence of surface features reduced the temperature by 14.6 degrees C and, while surface features had mixed effects on substrate moisture on the green roof, pebble piles slowed moisture loss during a 6-week drought in the glasshouse. 4. Following drought conditions, seedling density and species richness were greatest, relative to seeded controls, where substrate was deep on the green roof and where pebbles were present in glasshouse modules, despite high mortality overall. Design modifications did not result in differentiation of seedling communities among different microsite types. Species accumulation curves showed no difference in species richness between aggregates of modified vs. unaltered microsites. 5. Synthesis and applications. Redistribution of green roof substrate and the addition of logs and pebble piles altered microsite conditions and created habitat heterogeneity on a green roof. These design modifications represent a minimalist strategy to ameliorate growing conditions, improve seedling survival and decrease species loss on shallow substrate green roofs.","MAR",2018

In this study, our aim was to test a number of commonly used structural (e.g. Shannon-Wiener, Average Taxonomic Diversity (Delta), M-AMBI) and functional indicators (e.g. BTA, BPc) currently used in benthic research and monitoring programmes on the Eden estuary (Scotland). Historically the estuary has a legacy of high nutrient conditions and was designated as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2003, whence major management measures were implemented in order to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms. We therefore collected data on intertidal macro-benthic communities over a sixteen year interval, covering a pre-management (1999) and post-management (2015) period to assess the effectiveness of the intended restoration efforts. In the post-management period, the results suggested an improvement in the structure and functioning of the estuary as a whole, but macro-benthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. The greatest improvements were noticed in the upper and central sites of the estuary with functional traits analysis suggesting an increased ability of these sites to provide ecosystem services associated with the benthic environment such as carbon and organic matter cycling. Generally, almost all of the structural and functional indicators detected the prevailing environmental conditions (with the exception of (Pielou's index and Average Taxonomic Diversity (.)), highlighting the appropriateness of such methods to be used in monitoring the recovery of transitional systems. This research also provides a robust baseline to monitor further management actions in the Eden estuary and provides evidence that notable reductions in nitrate concentrations resulting from NVZ designations may result in significant improvements to benthic structure and functioning.

We use quantitative plant samples of 1 m(2) plots from the first 6 years of initial vegetation dynamics in a German created catchment to infer the temporal changes in plant functional trait space and multifunctionality. Multifunctionality at the plot level was in all study years lower than expected from a random sample of the local pool of potential colonizers and was lowest at intermediate states of succession. In each year species containing a specific set of traits occurred with limited but focused functionality. The observed average low degree of multifunctionality contrasts with recent models predicting a tendency towards maximum multifunctionality during plant community development. However, variability in multifunctionality among plots increased during succession and the respective multifunctionality distribution among plots was increasingly right skewed indicating an excess of plots with relatively high multifunctionality. This relative excess of plots with high multifunctionality might act as an important trigger of community development paving the way for new species and functions to become established.","MAY",2019

Agri-environment schemes attempt to counteract the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest control in agro-ecosystems. However, only a few studies have evaluated whether these attempts are successful. 2. We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely adopted agri-environment scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM). 3. We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of three insect-pollinated, non-autogamous 'phytometer' species (Raphanus sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites. 4. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent IM. Species richness and abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and abundance; the area of an ECA had no significant influence. 5. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and heavier seeds in ECA than in IM. Furthermore, the number of seeds of these two phytometer species was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of bees. No such effects were observed for individual plants of H. radicata. The number of fruits and seeds per plant of R. sativus in IM decreased with increasing distance from ECA. 6.

We tested whether this goal can be achieved in the case of the agri-environmental restoration scheme implemented for Swiss grassland using five large arthropod taxa (bees, true bugs, orthopterans, ground beetles and spiders) representing different ecological and functional groups. The species richness and abundance of all groups and species, respectively, was measured along 100 m transects from ECA-meadows into the adjacent intensively managed grassland at 24 sites. Species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles, and the abundance of 63% of the 234 arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ECA-meadows than in their surroundings, while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher in intensively managed meadows. The abundance of 8% of these species were only increased in the ECA-meadows themselves (""stenotopic"" species) but 40% had increased abundance both in the ECA-meadows and the adjacent grassland, declining exponentially with increasing distance from ECA-meadows (""edge species""). The 90%-decay distances for these edge species differed among taxonomic groups (117 +/- 18 m for true bugs, 137 +/- 24 m for spiders, 152 +/- 34 m for bees, 167 +/- 5.7 m for orthopterans, 185 +/- 34 m for ground beetles; mean 1 standard error) and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large-sized or predacious species than for small-sized or phytophagous species. Because the average distance between neighbouring ECA-meadows in Swiss grassland is only 73 +/- 4 m, the current agri-environment scheme very likely enhances arthropod diversity and possibly associated ecosystem services in the Swiss agricultural landscape at large.

We assessed the effects of landscape features on nearshore habitats and biological communities, relating subtidal habitat, shoreline condition, upland land use and nearshore fish communities in a Chesapeake Bay tributary, the James River, Virginia. Both upland development and the placement of erosion control structures on the shoreline were associated with reduced fish community integrity, and shoreline alterations were linked with the amount of subtidal structural habitat in the nearshore. Ecological thresholds in nekton community integrity were evident at >= 23% developed land use within 200 and 1000 m buffer increments. Nekton assemblages at sites with low development (< 23%) and natural or riprap shorelines were different from all other combinations of altered conditions (low development with bulkhead, and high development with riprap or bulkhead). Species composition along natural or riprap revetment shorelines with low upland development tended to be diverse and inclusive of tidal marsh species, while highly developed sites or bulkhead shorelines were dominated by a few generalist species. The complex interaction between watershed (both nearshore and inland) and shoreline development presents a unique challenge for coastal planning. Alternate moderating approaches for coastal development may include preservation of riparian buffers, the placement of living shorelines for erosion control where appropriate, and development of targeting tools to identify landscapes near an ecological threshold.",NA,2008

A century of habitat degradation has resulted in substantial reductions in the extent and quality of oyster reefs in many estuaries, thus spurring restoration efforts. In this study, a 1.5 ha oyster reef complex was constructed in Copano Bay, Texas to restore habitat for oysters and associated fauna. Oysters and resident and transient fishes and crustaceans were monitored at the restored reef as well as at nearby natural oyster reef and unrestored bottom (i.e., dense mud with shell hash) habitats for two years following reef construction. The restored reef had substantial oyster recruitment and growth, with oyster abundance and size comparable to nearby habitats within the first year. Resident and transient fauna communities recruited to the restored reef within six months post-construction, and abundance and diversity were comparable to nearby habitats. Significant changes observed in oyster densities between the first and second year post-restoration demonstrate the importance of monitoring over multiple years to capture multiple recruitment cycles and growth to market size. Nekton densities did not change significantly after the first year, but changes in community assemblages were observed through the end of the study. The high densities of oysters and resident nekton relative to other studies indicate that this restoration project was successful in restoring suitable habitat. The design of the reef complex, consisting of relatively high-relief reef mounds and deeper corridors, likely contributed to the relatively high oyster and nekton densities observed in this study. Overall, the restored reef in this study showed tremendous near-term success in providing important ecological functions associated with habitat provision and oyster production.","43753",2018

However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects.","OCT",2015

This article presents a trait-based multi-criteria framework to evaluate and predict the performance of 17 plant seedlings to improve ecological restoration of marly eroded areas in the French Southern Alps. The suitability of these species to limit soil erosion was assessed by studying both their response to erosive forces and their effect on erosion dynamics. We assumed that species efficiency could be explained and predicted from plant traits and we looked for trait-performance relationships. Our results showed that root slenderness ratio, the percentage of fine roots and root system topology, were the three root morphology traits best describing anchorage strength. Root system characterized by a long and thin tap root and many fine lateral ramifications would be the best to resist concentrated runoff. Species response to burial mainly depended on growth form and morphological flexibility. The abilities of species in reinforcing the soil and reducing erosion rates were negatively correlated to root diameter and positively to the percentage of fine roots. Moreover, root system density and root tensile strength also influenced root reinforcement. Finally, the ability to trap sediment was positively correlated to leaf area and canopy density. Species were then scored and classified in four clusters according to their global performance. This method allows identifying species that possess both response and effect traits related to the goal of preventing erosion during ecological restoration.","SEP",2014

The case of the western boundaries of Mexico City is used to map and assess these issues. We classified the different settings of green infrastructure as Service Providing Units (SPUs) and identified their provision of UES through remote sensing techniques; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) combined with fieldwork verification in two scales of analysis, the local and regional. The results reveal that the vast majority of green infrastructure has low quality, hindering the provision of the UES required for building Mexico City ' s resilience. At the regional scale, the growing pressures of urban development and the consequent reduction of SPUs threatens the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services while at the local scale, the low quality of SPUs threatens the provision of regulating ecosystem services.

We quantified bee communities in five pairs of crop-country: buckwheat in Poland, cantaloupe in France, field beans in the UK, spring oilseed rape in Sweden, and strawberries in Germany. For each country, 7-10 study fields were sampled over a gradient of increasing proportion of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. The CORINE land cover classification was used to characterize the landscape over a 3 km radius around each study field and we used multivariate and regression analyses to quantify the impact of landscape features on bee abundance and diversity at the sub-generic taxonomic level. Neither overall wild bee abundance nor diversity, taken as the number of sub-genera. was significantly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitat. Therefore, we used the most precise level of the CORINE classification to examine the possible links between specific landscape features and wild bee communities. Bee community composition fell into three distinct groups across Europe: group I included Poland, Germany, and Sweden, group 2 the UK, and group 3 France. Among all three groups, wild bee abundance and sub-generic diversity were affected by 17 landscape elements including some semi-natural habitats (e.g., transitional wood land-shrub), some urban habitats (e.g., sport and leisure facilities) and some crop habitats (e.g., non-irrigated arable land). Some bee taxa were positively affected by urban habitats only, others by semi-natural habitats only, and others by a combination of semi-natural, urban and crop habitats. Bee sub-genera favoured by urban and crop habitats were more resistant to landscape change than those favoured only by semi-natural habitats. In agroecosystems, the agricultural intensification defined as the loss of semi-natural habitats does not necessarily cause a decline in evenness at the local level, but can change community composition towards a bee fauna dominated by common taxa.

Mechanical harvesting is an alternative approach that removes tissue-bound phosphorus and nitrogen and can increase wetland plant diversity and aquatic connectivity between wetland and lacustrine systems. In this study, we used data from three years of Great Lakes-wide wetland plant surveys, published literature, and bioenergy analyses to quantify the overall areal extent of GLCWs, the extent and biomass of the three most dominant invasive plants, the pools of nitrogen and phosphorus contained within their biomass, and the potential for harvesting this biomass to remediate nutrient runoff and produce renewable energy. Of the approximately 212,000 ha of GLCWs, three invasive plants (invasive cattail, common reed, and reed canary grass) dominated 76,825 ha (36%). The coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario exhibited the highest proportion of invasive dominance (57%) of any of the Great Lakes, primarily from cattail. A single growing season's biomass of these invasive plants across all GLCWs was estimated at 659,545 metric tons: 163,228 metric tons of reed canary grass, 270,474 metric tons of common reed, and 225,843 metric tons of invasive cattail, and estimated to contain 10,805 and 1144 metric tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively.

Anticipating change in ecosystem services is a pressing challenge that requires understanding how species respond to an environmental change, and how they contribute to ecosystem services. Building on analogous efforts by plant ecologists, we propose a trait-based framework that aims to predict the resistance and recovery of coral ecosystem services against both pulse and press disturbances. The framework involves identifying effect, resistance, and recovery traits across coral species and using these to ascertain how species might (1) contribute to a service, (2) resist disturbance, and (3) recover after the disturbance. By identifying trait functional overlaps and quantifying correlations among the trait types, the framework can yield a better understanding of the potential mechanistic links between community assembly, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a virtual scenario, implemented via simulation, in which habitat provisioning is the focal ecosystem service, and cyclones and bleaching events are the disturbances of interest. This demonstration required us to assemble an extensive dataset of relevant traits-a process that revealed key gaps in the coral trait database and in our understanding of coral functional ecology. The framework can provide predictive power for the resilience of ecosystem services and can also help identify crucial knowledge gaps, research objectives, and strategies for applying a trait-based approach to advancing coral reef science and conservation.","MAY",2018

The rehabilitation of productive wetlands plays an important role in improving this functionality in degraded wetlands, but it is not well-known to what extent these activities improve acid mine drainage impacted waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of the effect of such interventions on the ecological functioning of a test wetland affected by acid mine drainage. A degraded wetland influenced by acid mine drainage in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa was identified for the case study. This site was rehabilitated using a variety of hard (e.g., weirs/dams) and soft (e.g., earth berms) structures and examined to determine whether its ecological functioning (i.e., the improvement of water quality) and biotic community structures have improved. From the results it was evident that a substantial improvement in water quality occurred below the rehabilitated area, even though the wetland still continued to receive acid mine drainage. This was observed through the decrease in metal pollution in conjunction with an increase in pH and alkalinity levels. This resulted in increased productivity, reduced toxicity (embryotoxicity and teratogenicity), as well as changes in the biotic community structures which were a reflection of a less polluted environment. The study has shown that the rehabilitation of ecological infrastructure can be used to mitigate the effect of coal mining related pollution such as acid mine drainage. In the face of ever increasing land use activities that occur globally to meet the demands of growing populations, this information can be useful to mitigate negative residual influences resulting from these activities, e.g. acid mine drainage.

Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification.","43709",2017

However, in some tropical agricultural systems, conserving natural habitat can simultaneously protect threatened species and support important ecosystem services. Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly throughout the tropics but the extent to which non-crop habitat supports biodiversity and ecosystem services in these landscapes is poorly documented. We investigated whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves) provide a pest control service or increase pest activity (disservice) within oil palm dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the activity of potential predators of pest herbivores usingplasticine caterpillar mimics and quantified herbivory rates on oil palm fronds in areas with and without riparian reserves. We also manipulated the shape and colour of the mimics to assess the extent to which artificial pest mimics reflect a predatory response. The presence of riparian reserves increased the attack rate on mimics by arthropods, but not by birds. Our methodological study suggested attacks on artificial pest mimics provide a better indication of predatory activity for birds than for arthropod predators. Herbivory rates were also not significantly affected by the presence of a riparian reserve, but we found some evidence that herbivory rates may decrease as the size of riparian reserves increases. Overall, we conclude that riparian forest fragments of 30-50 m width on each side of the river are unlikely to provide a pest control service. Nevertheless, our results provide evidenc ethat these riparian buffer strips do not increase the density of defoliating pests, which should reassure managers concerned about possible negative consequences of preserving riparian buffers.

We generate different rainfall scenarios with fixed total annual rainfall but shifts in (i) frequency vs. intensity, (ii) rainy season length vs. frequency, (iii) intensity vs. rainy season length. These scenarios are fed into SEIB-DGVM to investigate changes in biome distributions and ecosystem productivity. We find a loss of ecosystem productivity with increased rainfall frequency and decreased intensity at very low rainfall regimes (<400 mm year(-1)) and low frequency (<0.3 event da(-1)); beyond these very dry regimes, most ecosystems benefit from increased frequency and decreased intensity, except in the wet tropics (>1800 mm year(-1)) where radiation limitation prevents further productivity gains. This result reconciles seemingly contradictory findings in previous field studies on the impact of rainfall frequency/intensity on ecosystem productivity. We also find that changes in rainy season length can yield more dramatic ecosystem responses compared with similar percentage changes in rainfall frequency or intensity, with the largest impacts in semi-arid woodlands. This study demonstrates that intra-seasonal rainfall characteristics play a significant role in influencing ecosystem function and structure through controls on ecohydrological processes. Our results suggest that shifts in rainfall seasonality have potentially large impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, and these understudied impacts should be explicitly examined in future studies of climate impacts.",NA,2014

His observations, along with his land management techniques, helped frame his seminal book, A Sand County Almanac. After his death, two interstate highways were built near his property and subjected this historically significant area to traffic noise. While highways currently represent vital transportation corridors, their observed and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services are cause for concern. As the area including Leopolds shack is now an Important Bird Area, we sought to evaluate the impact of these highways on the bird community and its related acoustic diversity. In 2011, 150 avian point counts were conducted in the three main habitats composing the landscape-upland deciduous forest, floodplain forest, and herbaceous wetland. In 2012, soundscape recordings were collected in seven floodplain forest sites using automated passive acoustic recorders. We described the local bird communities and measured their acoustic diversity. Linear models accounting for additional factors including land cover and vegetation structure characteristics showed that as the distance from highways increased, bird community descriptors (overall abundance and species richness) and acoustic diversity increased (when relationships were significant). On the species level, forest interior specialists were negatively affected by the presence of the highways, contrary to edge specialists. In addition to the direct effects of the edges produced by the highway structure, this difference might be due to the masking effect of traffic noise on interior specialists low-frequency vocalizations and their reliance on acoustic, as opposed to visual, communication. We conclude that while habitat structure is a principle driver of bird diversity on a broader scale, highway-induced changes in both habitat structure and soundscapes may affect bird communities.","DEC",2019

Characterising the consequences of invasions for ecological processes and corresponding ecosystem services is fundamental to this decision-making process, but requires an understanding of impacts across physical, chemical, and biological responses. Accordingly, we evaluated the multi-trophic impacts of the invasive macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum (Haloragaceae; parrotfeather) along the mainstem Chehalis River, Washington, U.S.A. Weexamined invertebrate, plant and fish community responses to varying degrees of parrotfeather abundance and simultaneously characterised variation in physical structure and dissolved oxygen (DO) across the dominant native and non-native plant species. DO concentrations were significantly reduced and approached hypoxic levels in areas dominated by parrotfeather compared with native vegetation. Increased structural complexity, volume and biomass of parrotfeather was associated with increased diversity of epiphytic invertebrates. However, these more diverse invertebrate assemblages were dominated by amphipods, whereas native macrophytes were characterised by cladocerans, chironomids and gastropods. Non-native fishes (primarily centrarchid species) were more strongly associated with sites where parrotfeather was present and diversity of non-native fishes was positively correlated along a gradient of parrotfeather abundance. Native fish associated with parrotfeather areas were those that tend to be tolerant of degraded or lower quality habitats. We saw little evidence of exclusion of other macrophytes; native and non-native plant diversity and abundance were positively correlated with the parrotfeather gradient. This may reflect that analysis was done at a site level, and competitive dominance might be apparent by changes in species richness at smaller (plot) scales or over longer periods. Alternatively, parrotfeather may demonstrate minimal effects on native plant composition. Given the effects observed across multiple habitat characteristics and biota, parrotfeather appears to be a highly impactful invader where it establishes. Many of the changes we observed appear to derive from the emergent leaves and dense mat formation of parrotfeather compared with a submersed structure more typical of the native community. Our results suggest that managers should specifically consider contrasting characteristics between non-native and native physical structure when assessing and prioritising threats of invasive macrophytes.","NOV",2016

Using the InVEST modelling suite, we evaluated critical ES dynamics in four zones of varying plantation expansion intensity (high, medium, low and no plantation expansion) in Xishuangbanna prefecture in Southwest China from 1976 to 2012. Based on these results, we also exmained the relationship between ES and landscape pattern and connectivity derived by the ""probability of connectivity"" model. We found that during the study period, plantation area increased more than 20 times in Xishuangbanna prefecture as a whole, while broad-leaved forest cover decreased by nearly 30%. The impact of plantation on ES was substantial at both the regional and local scale. Carbon stocks and water yield services decreased by 15.48% and 10.85%, respectively, from 1976 to 2012 throughout the region as a whole. Within the selected study zones, carbon stock and water yeild decreased by 45% and 32%, respectively, from the no plantation to the high plantation zones in 2012 specifically. Plantation expansion has also resulted in a decrease in natural forest cover and a high level of habitat fragmentation. Landscape connectivity decreased by a range of 54.64-95.58% throughout the study area, with 134.58 km(2) of forest patches of high importance reduced to medium or low importance during the study period. Correlation analysis showed that carbon storage was more closely correlated to landscape connectivity than forest habitat percentage, large patch index or cohesion index. Together, these results highlight that habitat configuration with a high connectivity level between fragmented patches is important for maintaining critical Ecosystem Services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This approach is particularly useful for the evaluation of cultural landscapes, which represent the joint evolution of humans and nature across an extended time span. Transhumance is a customary practice of mobile pastoralism, involving the regular seasonal migration of livestock herds between summer and winter pasturelands. This practice maintains unique cultural landscapes in Mediterranean Spain, which have been shaped over many centuries of pastoral activity. Drove roads, which are used for herd migration, represent the most outstanding feature of these landscapes. We used visually based landscape interpretation to evaluate social perceptions of ecosystem services provided by the Conquense Drove Road transhumance landscape in Spain. Face-to-face questionnaires (N = 314) were given to a sample of local inhabitants, visitors, and urban inhabitants. The questionnaires contained two pairs of photographs depicting images of croplands and pine forests associated with the transhumance landscape, with one photograph in each pair containing a drove road. We compared the social perceptions of 16 ecosystem services supplied by these two landscapes. These 16 services were divided into 3 types: provisioning, such as the production of food and water; regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; and cultural, such as spiritual and recreational benefits. We also identified differences between landscapes with and without a drove road. Overall, respondents recognized the higher capacity of forests to deliver a wider range of ecosystem services to society compared with croplands. Provisioning services were mostly associated with cropland, whereas regulating services and cultural ecosystem services tended to be related to forests. All three types of ecosystem services were more perceived by respondents when a drove road was present in each landscape. However, differences in the visual perception of ecosystem services supply and preference for transhumance landscapes emerged in relation to certain socio-demographic and cultural respondent characteristics such as a previous relationship with transhumance and agriculture, rural/urban origin and identity, environmental awareness, and cultural attachment to a place. Four groups of respondents had consistent and diverging ecosystem services appreciation, revealing various potential conflicts and trade-offs. We discuss the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach for evaluating ecosystem services in cultural landscapes and for informing policy-making processes.",NA,2014

Decisions made by urban residents affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial, ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by neighborhood socioeconomics.","DEC",2016

While there is some evidence that a non-biodiversity focus in the spatial configuration of conservation networks could severely compromise biodiversity gains there is no work examining whether this is also true for the spatial allocation of restoration effort. We sought to identify scenarios where large trade-offs between biodiversity and non-biodiversity objectives in the spatial allocation of restoration effort are likely to occur, in an attempt to assess whether such trade-offs will be a general problem for prioritising restoration effort. To this end we examined trade-offs between biodiversity and environmental impact reduction when allocating afforestation effort in a highly modified catchment in New Zealand. We then used simulations on artificial data to derive general predictions about when large trade-offs are most likely to occur. We found significant trade-offs between gains in biodiversity and reduction of three environmental impacts - nitrogen leaching, greenhouse gas emissions and erosion - in the spatial allocation of restoration effort. The biggest trade-offs were between biodiversity gain and erosion reduction, which both had right-skewed distributions (i.e. many small and few large values) and were weakly negatively correlated. The simulations showed that trade-offs will be greatest for strongly right skewed variables that are negatively correlated with competing variables. However, simulations also demonstrated that strongly right skewed variables experience large trade-offs even in the absence of negative correlations with competing variables. Biodiversity gain through ecological restoration is likely to be strongly right skewed, with restoration in specific types of environment or habitat giving extremely high gains in representativeness. Consequently, there may be a general tendency for a non-biodiversity-focus in restoration planning to greatly compromise biodiversity gain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","OCT",2012

G.","JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION","The assessment and monitoring of soil disturbance and its effect on soil quality (i.e., ability to support a range of ecosystem services) has been hindered due to the shortcomings of many traditional analytical techniques, including high cost, long-term time investment and difficulties with data interpretation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop rapid and repeatable approaches for quantifying changes in soil quality that land managers may use to assess the condition and trend of natural and managed ecosystems. Here we report on a rapid, high throughput approach using fingerprint Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric modeling. Fingerprint FTIR incorporates all information embedded within the FTIR spectrum, thus producing a biogeochemical or ecological ""fingerprint"" of the soil. This methodology was applied in a highly disturbed forest ecosystem over a 19-year sampling period to detect, via spectral analysis, changes in dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic matter and reactive mineralogy) that can indicate changes in soil quality. Two chemometric statistical techniques (i.e., hierarchical clustering analysis [HCA] and discriminate analysis of principal components [DAPC]) were evaluated for interpreting and quantifying similarities/dissimilarities between samples utilizing the entire FTIR spectra from each sample. We found that both statistical approaches provided a means for clearly discriminating between degraded soils, soils in recovery, and reference soils. DAPC analysis provided additional information on the spectral wavenumbers most important in differentiating between soil samples across our disturbance time series. Wavenumbers relating to stretching of phenolic (C-O), aromatic (C=C, C-C), carboxylic acids (C=O), and to a lesser extent aliphatic (C-H) bonds were important in discriminating between soil samples. These results confirmed our visual interpretation of FTIR spectra, where an increase in aliphatic (fats and lipids) and decrease in phenolic/aromatic (lignin) absorption occurred following intensive site disturbance, followed by a return to predisturbance absorption values 17 years later. Results from this study illustrate the potential of fingerprint FTIR and chemometrics as an efficient technique for quantifying changes in soil quality that may be used in the monitoring and assessment of soil landscape change. Additional research across a range of soil ecosystems and under different types of ecosystem disturbance is needed to further validate this approach and to demonstrate its wide applicability as a land management tool.","JUL-AUG",2018

Complex social and ecological processes drive vegetation cover in cities, leading to heterogeneity in C dynamics depending on regional climate, land use, and land cover. Recent work has demonstrated homogenization in ecological processes within human-dominated landscapes (the urban convergence hypothesis) in soils and biotic communities. However, a lack of information on vegetation in arid land cities has hindered an understanding of potential C storage and NPP convergence across a diversity of ecosystem types. We estimated C storage and NPP of trees and shrubs for six different land-use types in the arid metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and compared those results to native desert ecosystems, as well as other urban and natural systems around the world. Results from Phoenix do not support the convergence hypothesis. In particular, C storage in urban trees and shrubs was 42% of that found in desert vegetation, while NPP was only 20% of the total NPP estimated for comparable natural ecosystems. Furthermore, the overall estimates of C storage and NPP associated with urban trees in the CAP ecosystem were much lower (8-63%) than the other cities included in this analysis. We also found that C storage (175.25-388.94g/m(2)) and NPP (8.07-15.99gm(-2).yr(-1)) were dominated by trees in the urban residential land uses, while in the desert, shrubs were the primary source for pools (183.65g/m(2)) and fluxes (6.51gm(-2).yr(-1)). These results indicate a trade-off between shrubs and trees in arid ecosystems, with shrubs playing a major role in overall C storage and NPP in deserts and trees serving as the dominant C pool in cities.

The consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functions and services depend on the level of functional redundancy - the number of species with similar ecological functional traits. Using field data on fish assemblages from 199 coral reef and lagoon sites from six islands, and on local fisheries from four islands in The Bahamas, we examined levels of functional diversity and redundancy within these assemblages and determined how fish biomass and local fisheries catches vary with local diversity. A majority of functional groups contain few species, suggesting that these assemblages have limited functional redundancy. Most also include species targeted by local fisheries, thus fishing has the potential to broadly impact food webs. Comparisons between a large marine reserve and fished reefs confirm that fishing significantly reduces functional redundancy and removes whole functional groups. Positive exponential relationships of fish biomass and fisheries catches with species and functional diversity highlight that even small declines in biodiversity may result in large reductions in secondary production and seafood provision. Taken together, these results indicate that Caribbean fish assemblages have low functional redundancy and high vulnerability of ecosystem functions and services to diversity loss, and that protection of multi-species assemblages is needed to maintain functions and services.

Development and coastal population growth are the leading causes for habitat losses. Recently, the restoration of marine habitats has increased, especially with the goal of increasing non-consumptive ecosystem services derived from mangrove and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) along with biogenic oyster reefs. Habitats reside in landscapes dominated by multiple species. Rather than focusing on a single habitat such as oysters or mangroves or SAV, we took an approach restoring multiple adjacent habitats to accelerate restoration in a Florida embayment that had been significantly degraded prior to the restoration of natural tidally generated flows. After a multiple habitat die-off, a project was initiated in 2006 to reintroduce tidal flushing. The re-introduction of tidal flushing, however, did not result in immediate recovery of mangrove shorelines or oyster-dominated reefs. There was a lack of mangrove propagule production and significant substrate limitation in areas with appropriate salinity, sediment and tidal flows. From 2009-2012, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules were collected (over 500,000) and planted for a total area of 3.24 ha. From 2009-2010, five intertidal reefs were constructed by adding bagged and fossil shell (54 MT) for Crassostrea virginica larvae to recruit onto totaling over 779 m(2). Monitoring of planted mangrove versus unplanted shorelines demonstrated that prop root and drop root densities were higher where propagules were planted (28 m(-2)) versus unplanted (2.3 m(-2)). Oyster densities and mean sizes (multiple year classes) at new and natural reefs were measured after 8, 12, and 24, and 36 months. An initial settlement pulse was observed in the first 8 months followed by an increase in the density of greater than 1-year old oysters. Xanthid crab densities (Eurypanopeus depressus and Panopeus spp.) in restored reefs and natural reefs were similar, while Petrolisthes armatus densities were lower in restored reefs. Whole reef seston filtration rates over restored reefs were -26 to 157 L m(-2) h(-1) when measured at 4,15, 28, and 40 months. A multiple habitat approach may be useful in accelerating the natural ecological succession, especially if the project site has reached a degraded, alternate ecological state.

Bird and tree diversity was higher in gallery forest fragments compared to hedgerows and isolated tree islands within rangelands. Forest fragments shared over 50% of their bird and tree species with tree islands and hedgerows, yet communities differed markedly. Tree islands and hedgerows had relatively more endozoochorous and small-seeded tree species and hosted birds of forest, savanna and shrubland, while forest fragments had more synzoochorous and large-seeded tree species and primarily hosted forest birds. Hedges and tree islands contribute to the conservation of forest bird and tree biodiversity in rangeland, but gallery forests are essential for the conservation of less tolerant forest species. The savanna rangeland acts as an ecological filter between the gallery forests and the hedges and tree islands, which in turn facilitate the spillover of tolerant forest birds and their ecological functions, including tree seed dispersal, into the rangeland, and thus support regional forest conservation and restoration.

Here we propose that trait-based ecology may be expanded for understanding urban biodiversity in human planted and human dominated land cover by including plant attributes that influence human choices about cultivated species in novel ecosystems. We measured leaf functional traits in 24 tree species grown in the Los Angeles region of southern California in order to assess whether leaf functional traits were (1) predictable based on biogeographic region of origin, and (2) related to urban plant performance and ecosystem-services based traits. This entailed the development of a proposed new, ecosystem services-based classification of tree species traits is based on; 1000 household surveys of the preferences of urban residents for specific tree attributes in southern California. We evaluated the relationship between leaf functional traits, ecosystem services-based traits, and urban tree performance as measured by stem growth and predawn leaf water potential (as a metric of rooting distributions). Leaf functional traits were strongly predictable based on species' biogeographic region of origin including native habitat type and continent of origin, and hence appeared to be conserved in the urban environment. Ecosystem services-based traits such as tree water use, provision of showy flowers, size at maturity, and growth rates were also predictable based on geographic region of origin, and several ecosystem services-based traits were related to leaf functional traits. We suggest that ecosystem services-based traits may be useful variables to quantify in studies of urban forest community assembly, where species composition is strongly influenced by decision-making based on the preferences of urban residents and stakeholders. Our initial ecosystem services-based trait classification is defined from the results of household surveys and measurements in the Los Angeles area; these results are likely to vary by location, and can be improved with additional data on the performance, physiology, and morphology of urban trees as well as a better understanding of human preferences by region.","JUN",2013

We investigated spatial fit between 30 different public water policies and four hydrologic services (surface and groundwater quality, freshwater supply, and flood regulation) in the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin, USA)-a Midwestern landscape that typifies tensions between agriculture, urban development, and freshwater resources. Spatial extent of water policy implementation was mapped, and indicators of hydrologic services were quantified for subwatersheds using empirical estimates and validated spatial models. We found a spatial misfit between the overall spatial implementation of water policy and regions of water quality concern, indicating a need for better targeting. Water quality policies can also be leveraged to protect other hydrologic services such as freshwater supply and flood regulation. Individual policy application areas varied substantially in their spatial congruence with each hydrologic service, indicating that not all services are protected by a single policy and highlighting the need for a broad spectrum of policies to sustain hydrologic services in diverse landscapes. We also identified where future policies could be targeted for improving hydrologic services. Joint spatial analysis of policies and ecosystem services is effective for assessing spatial aspects of institutional fit, and provides a foundation for guiding future policy efforts.","JAN",2017

We focus on Sahelian multiple-use forest ecosystems and set out to analyze policy-induced changes in the patterns of interactions between various uses, users, and dry-forest ecosystems, interactions that influence the effective management of rural forests. We put forward the hypothesis that the new forest policy reforms were designed according to a vulnerability diagnosis, highlighting two stressors: droughts and increased demand for firewood. This led to a single-issue policy focused on firewood provision and was implemented through the Household Energy Strategy (HES). The HES established new local management schemes for ""rural forests"" through ""rural firewood markets"" (RMs) to regulate firewood harvesting and trade. We studied one of the first rural forests to become an RM in Niger in 1993. We used the concept of social-ecological functions as processes emerging from the interactions between social and ecological systems (SES). We identified sixteen SES functions and specifically analyzed the changes in three of them, whether they were targeted by the policy reform (firewood provision) or not (gum provision and livestock production). The changes generated by the creation of the RM have had different impacts on SES functions, as well as on the social and ecological components that contribute to these functions, because of their interaction with firewood provision. Mutual benefits and competitions between SES functions have been identified. The analysis of mutual benefits and competitions reflects the ambiguous role of the policy reform on rural forest ecosystems in Niger. Our results show that the patterns of interactions between key SES functions have played a more important role in the SES trajectory than any single resource such as timber or firewood. This provides insight into strengthening potential feedback between rural forest functions for improved resilience and livelihoods.",NA,2012

However, there is growing concern that increasing levels of burning, particularly on deep peat, are impacting upon upland ecosystems. We used linear mixed models to examine the influence of burning on heather Calluna vulgaris (L.) height and structure, and on grouse density and breeding success, at 36 moors in northern England which practiced driven grouse shooting and employed full-time gamekeepers to burn heather, but also to control generalist predators of grouse and their parasitic nematode worms. Variation in heather height was positively associated with burning extent on moors and the relationship between heather height and burning was similar on moors of deep (blanket bog) and shallow peat (heath). Grouse pre-breeding density was not related to burning extent, but breeding success and post-breeding density were positively associated with extent of burning on moors. Relationships between grouse and burning were similar on heath and blanket bog. Higher grouse breeding success and post-breeding density were likely to be associated with a more varied vegetation structure following burning. Rotational burning is associated with higher grouse breeding success and post-breeding densities beneficial for driven grouse shooting. Thus a conflict may exist between rotational burning to benefit grouse and potential impacts of burning on ecosystem services such as carbon storage and flood protection. Potential benefits of burning for increasing grouse breeding success and post-breeding density need to be considered carefully against any likely impacts on ecosystem services, particularly in areas of blanket peat.",NA,2017

Nevertheless, inventories, monitoring, and management generally focus on vertebrates and flowering plants. Consequently, there are few guidelines or case studies for invertebrates. We present a procedure for developing a monitoring program for species-rich invertebrates that entails (1) characterizing the community; (2) identifying surrogates for biodiversity; and (3) establishing efficient methods to monitor surrogates and any ecologically important or sensitive taxa. We used these procedures, biodiversity-based statistical advances, and a survey of arthropods to develop a monitoring plan for the forests of Shenandoah National Park, Virginia (U.S.A.). Our case study revealed that mixed hardwood and hemlock forests had significantly different compositions of arthropods in their soil and understory strata. Of the 10 orders tested Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were the only two to pass most of the five surrogate tests, and their combination improved predictions of overall arthropod diversity. Because arthropods represent the majority of macroscopic species in most ecosystems, the ability of this assemblage to predict overall arthropod diversity makes it a powerful surrogate. Of the 11 collecting methods used, the beat-sheet method was the most efficient for monitoring this surrogate assemblage. To complement this coarse-filter approach to monitoring at-risk, invasive, or other important taxa (fine filter), we used ordination analyses to match 66 taxa with the methods that most effectively sampled them. Our methods serve as a model for developing an invertebrate monitoring plan and should facilitate linking such monitoring with ecosystem functions and management.","APR",2007

The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

The benthic ecosystem contributes to human well-being by providing essential services such as food production and nutrient cycling. Although meiofauna are well-recognised as an abundant and ubiquitous component of benthic communities, empirical evidence of their wider role in marine ecosystems is scattered across the literature. Some ecologists and decision-makers thus remain sceptical about what meiofauna can tell them about the provision of ecosystem services. This article investigates empirical evidence on the roles of meiofauna in benthic ecosystems using a conceptual model that links the supply of an ecosystem service. the ecosystem processes that contribute to that service (e.g. production, consumption and decomposition of organic matter, nutrient regeneration, and energy transfer to higher trophic levels) and the meiofaunal activities (e.g. bioturbation and feeding) that regulate these processes. Meiofauna activities modify a series of physical, chemical and biological sediment properties. They often do so simultaneously by, for example, displacing sediment grains during burrow construction and displacing organic matter and microorganisms within the sediment matrix during feeding. These modifications directly and indirectly, positively and negatively affect various ecosystem services including sediment stabilisation, biochemical cycling, waste removal and food web dynamics, at various spatial and temporal scales. Meiofauna can mediate ecosystem processes in sediments with little or no macrofauna, thereby increasing the resilience of those benthic ecosystem processes that are essential for the continued delivery of ecosystem services desired by society. This is of growing importance since benthic ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Whilst studies over the past five decades have emphasised the important roles meiofauna play in benthic ecosystems, future studies will need to determine how consistent and widespread these roles are.

M.; Rutgers, Michiel; Brussaard, Lijbert; Mulder, Christian","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","Functional traits capture characteristics of organisms that determine their individual response to environmental pressures, providing a mechanistic understanding of habitat responses and the effects on ecological processes. Trait-based approaches have already been reported for separate soil groups like bacteria, nematodes and collembolans but investigating these groups together could bring better insights in assessing both environmental pressures and state of the systems. Still, selecting a suite of single traits that might encompass the large heterogeneity in soil biota remains a challenge for community trait based analyses. We sampled arable fields and their adjacent (buffer zone) margins to investigate overall trait-based responses of the soil community to agricultural management. We explored the suitability of three groups of functional traits (i.e. eco-physiological traits, behavioural traits and faunal morphological traits) to analyse how different components of the soil biota (fungi, bacteria, micro- and mesofauna) respond to agricultural management and to what extent the selected traits detect effects on soil functioning. For microbes, we opted for eco-physiological trait proxies due to the difficulties to study these organisms at individual level. Our results showed that eco-physiological traits reflected differences in nutrient cycling dynamics and carbon storage driven by the soil microbial community. The structural organization of micro- and the mesofauna trophic grouping and body mass distribution reflected effects of agricultural management on soil assemblages and revealed differences in the responses of these groups to the environment. We recognize some methodological limitations of our comprehensive community trait based approach. Yet our analysis reveals characteristics of the soil community structure and belowground ecological processes, as i.e. the partial shift from the bacterial- to the fungal-driven energy channels, that could not be detected by traditional methods, showing the potential of this approach in determining environmental pressures and in evaluating ecosystem services.

We tested the performance of experimentally sown annual flower strips specifically designed to promote natural enemies of aphids and their pest control services (tailored flower strips) in adjacent potato crops (n=8) compared with control fields (n=10). Flower strips consisted of 11 plant species providing abundant floral and extra-floral resources. The abundance of key natural enemies of aphids (hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds) and hoverfly species richness was greatly enhanced in tailored flower strips compared with potato control strips. This resulted in an average increase in the number of eggs deposited by hoverflies and lacewings by 127% and 48%, respectively, and a reduction in the number of aphids by 75% in adjacent potato crops.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that tailored flower strips can be an effective agri-environmental measure to enhance natural enemies and aphid control in nearby crops. Indeed, tailored flower strips may help to reduce insecticide input in potato production as they significantly decrease the probability that action thresholds are reached. Promoting natural enemy abundance and diversity, as observed for hoverflies, may increase the stability of pest control and provide additional benefits to agro-ecosystems in terms of natural enemy conservation. We thus recommend establishing tailored flower strips as a promising management option to reconcile the objectives of ecological intensification and biodiversity conservation.","AUG",2016

However, to propose management options for the production of such services, there is a need to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of net effects between ecosystem services and disservices provided by wild organisms across taxonomic groups in relation to habitat and landscape management. We studied the contribution of predatory vertebrates and invertebrates (including both carnivores and seed herbivores) to regulating ecosystem services and disservices in 16 cereal fields in response to a local habitat contrast and a landscape complexity gradient. From May to November 2016, we provided weed (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and crop (predation reflects a disservice) seeds, as well as pest (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and beneficial (predation reflects a disservice) invertebrate prey to predators. Seed predation was dominated by vertebrates, while vertebrates and invertebrates contributed equally to predation of animal prey. Before harvest, predation steadily increased from very low levels in May to high levels in July independent of the resource type. After harvest, ecosystem services declined more rapidly than disservices. The presence of adjacent seminatural grasslands promoted crop seed predation, but reduced pest prey predation. Predation on beneficial prey decreased with increasing proportions of seminatural grassland in the landscape. Predatory vertebrates and invertebrates provide important ecosystem services due to the consumption of pests. However, beneficial invertebrates and crop seeds were often consumed to a similar or even higher extent than harmful invertebrates or weed seeds. Our results therefore raise concerns that management options aimed at enhancing service providers may simultaneously increase levels of disservices. By considering positive and negative effects simultaneously, this study addresses an important knowledge gap and highlights the importance of interactions between local management, landscape composition, and service and disservice provision across taxa and over time. Considering trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices when evaluating the net effects of biodiversity conservation measures on ecosystem service provision is crucial. Future agri-environment schemes that offer payments for seminatural habitats may need to provide higher compensation for farmers in cases where net effects are likely to be negative.","DEC",2018

However, there are proposed bioenergy systems that can use biomass harvested from restored tallgrass prairie, creating a potential free market incentive for landowners to restore prairies. These alternative management practices may alter associated soil microbial communities and their ecosystem services. We examined changes in soil microbial community structure, function, and resiliency to drought following two prairie restorations from row-crop agriculture and through subsequent succession in a fertilized and unfertilized tallgrass prairie. The soil microbial community structure was assessed through amplicon (16S and ITS) sequencing, function through potential extracellular enzyme activity, and resiliency indices were calculated for both microbial diversity measures and extracellular enzyme activity. We hypothesized that 1) distinct soil microbial communities in each management system will continue to develop over time reflecting the extent of divergence between the plant communities, due to the strong selective forces plant communities have on the soil microbiome. 2) Microbial extracellular enzymatic function will continue to diverge between the management systems across sampling years. 3) We will see increased resiliency to drought in the prairies potentially due to the greater diversity in this management system for the microbial and plant community, creating a possible enhancement in functional redundancy. Our experiment demonstrates that soil microbial communities continue to diverge from row-crop agriculture as prairie restoration progresses. Planted prairie bioenergy systems with higher plant diversity supported greater microbial diversity than corn systems. Corn monocultures were less resistant to drought stress, as evidenced by decreased microbial activity and richness. Prairies with increased microbial diversity exhibited increased functional resiliency than corn systems, as measured by cellulose-degrading enzyme activity. Prairies that received nitrogen fertilization maintained high microbial diversity and activity, even under drought. Our study demonstrates that diverse cropping systems may benefit from nitrogen fertilization to confer resiliency to disturbance events. Increasing resiliency, while maintaining productivity, is key to managing alternative crops that are sustainable systems for biofuel uses. Our multi-year study reveals the benefits of long-term experiments for capturing the dynamic range of microbial mediation of soil carbon and nutrients and the importance of resiliency in both developing sustainable management systems and modeling predictive biogeochemical models.","43770",2018

Water samples were taken during the monsoon period from 61 locations in the river and on its floodplain. Analysis of floodwater hydrochemistry revealed a significant decreasing longitudinal trend for most dissolved solids, attributable to geological differences. We also observed a significant decreasing transverse trend from river to floodplain. Nutrient concentrations revealed lower dissolved nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium concentrations on the floodplain than in the river channel, which suggests the floodplain functions as a sink for nutrients and chemical species in the river floodwater. This sink function may be related to the presence of a belt of bamboo separating the river from the floodplain, which seems to acts as a sediment trap and nutrient filter, but this needs to be verified by additional dedicated research.","DEC",2016

Here, we evaluate methods of revegetating northern fescue prairies, disturbed by energy development, and test the hypothesis that higher richness of species seeded within disturbed areas improves the structure, diversity, and composition of revegetated communities. Our results demonstrate that disturbed northern fescue prairies are able to recover their structural elements, including vegetative and ground cover and plant litter, irrespective of the number of species in the seed mixes, even though revegetated areas remained similar in all measures of community diversity. Despite this, revegetated areas remained compositionally different from adjacent native prairies, 7 years following seeding treatments.

Seed presence in the right place and time is a prerequisite for pioneer establishment. We performed field surveys and manipulative seed-bank experiments on 2 mudflats with different levels of exposure in the Westerschelde, The Netherlands, to identify patterns of seed arrival and persistence and their role in determining seed bank abundance. Seed arrival decreased with distance from the seed-source area, i.e. the salt marsh, resulting in seeds being deposited on the mudflat close to the marsh edge. Once arrived, most of the surface seeds were washed away during subsequent tides, with retention of <20%. However, seed burial enhanced seed retention nonlinearly with increasing burial depth. Predation was not a major cause of seed loss. These results point to the importance of hydro dynamic and morphodynamic processes to both lateral seed dispersal and vertical seed burial on tidal flats and, therefore, suggest that saltmarsh establishment and expansion are closely linked to the physical dynamics of the entire estuarine system.","43760",2014

Participating in forest associations and diversifying income activities lead to greater charcoal production.

In the European Union, it might be expected that these differences should be highly diluted, because all countries have to comply with common directives issued by the European Commission. However, the subsidiarity principle may lead to the uneven uptake of European Union regulations, which can impact on biodiversity conservation due to unequal legislation in neighboring countries, particularly in the case of highly mobile organisms. Here we address this issue, by analyzing how EU regulations issued in response to the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis differentially affected vulture conservation in Portugal and Spain. Taking advantage of the intensive GPS-tracking of 60 griffon (Gyps fulvus) and 11 cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus) from Spain, we found that the Spanish-Portuguese border acts as a quasi-impermeable barrier. In fact, there was an abrupt decline in the number of vulture locations across the Spanish-Portuguese border, with modelling showing that this was unlikely to be related to differences in land cover or topography. Instead, the pattern found was likely due to differences in trophic resource availability, namely carcasses from extensive livestock husbandry, resulting from the differential application of European sanitary legislation regarding the mandatory removal of dead livestock from the field.

Here we investigate the effects of plant floral traits and trait diversity on flower visitation by three functionally distinct beneficial insect groups, which provide crop pollination and pest control services: bumblebees, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. We created plots that contained plants with either long or short-corolla flowers, as well as mixed plots, which contained plants presenting both floral traits concurrently. In functionally simple plots, insect groups exhibited distinct floral associations, with bumblebees being almost exclusively associated with long-corolla flower plots, whereas parasitoids and hoverflies strongly favoured plots with short-corolla flowers. When these flower types were planted in combination (mixed-trait plots), bumblebee and hoverfly visitation was maintained at the level of their respective preferred single-trait plot, but parasitoid visitation was reduced by 50%. Thus, the informed selection of functionally diverse flower patches can be an effective tool to attract a higher diversity of insect groups than functionally simple plots.

We used four approaches at different scales to gauge the potential of UFF to enhance urban sustainability and contribute to food security in the context of urbanization and climate change. First, we identified 37 current initiatives based around urban food trees, and analyzed their activities in three categories: planting, mapping, and harvesting, finding that the majority (73 %) only performed one activity, and only 8 % performed all three. Second, we analyzed 30 urban forestry master plans, finding that only 13 % included human food security among their objectives, while 77 % included habitat for wildlife. Third, we used Burlington, Vermont as a case study to quantify the potential fruit yield of publicly accessible open space if planted with Malus domestica (the common apple) under nine different planting and yield scenarios. We found that 108 % of the daily recommended minimum intake of fruit for the entire city's population could be met under the most ambitious planting scenario, with substantial potential to contribute to food security even under more modest scenarios. Finally, we developed a Climate-Food-Species Matrix of potential food trees appropriate for temperate urban environments as a decision-making tool. We identified a total of 70 species, 30 of which we deemed ""highly suitable"" for urban food forestry based on their cold hardiness, drought tolerance, and edibility.

Field-margin diversification through conservation and restoration of hedgerows is becoming a prominent intervention for promoting biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in intensive agricultural landscapes. However, how increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape can affect ecosystem services has rarely been considered. 2. Here, we assessed the effect of increased field-margin complexity at the local scale and increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape on the provision of pest control, weed control and potential pollination. Locally, three types of field margin were compared as follows: (i) standard grass margin, (ii) simple hedgerow and (iii) complex hedgerow, along two independent gradients of hedgerow cover and arable land cover in the landscape. We performed an exclusion experiment to measure biological control of cereal aphids and assessed natural enemy and pest abundance in the field. We sampled plant weed communities and performed a phytometer experiment to test the effects of pollinators on plant reproductive success. 3. At the local scale, planting a new hedgerow or improving its structural complexity and vegetation diversity did not enhance the delivery of ecosystem services in the neighbouring field. 4. However, high cover of hedgerows in the landscape enhanced aphid parasitism (from 12 to 18%) and potential pollination (visitation rate and seed set increased up to 70%) irrespective of local margin quality. The cover of arable land in the landscape reduced the abundance of plant-dwelling predators and weed diversity, but did not affect the delivery of the investigated ecosystem services. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the key importance of the surrounding landscape context, rather than local factors, to the delivery of ecosystem services. This suggests a need for new policies that pay particular attention to the conservation of hedgerows at large scales for promoting multiple ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Specifically, hedgerows can serve to develop a network of ecological corridors that can facilitate the movement of beneficial organisms, such as pollinators and natural enemies in the agricultural matrix. Such interventions may be a 'low cost-high benefit solution', since farmers can create or conserve high-quality habitats taking little or no land from crop production and without the need to change their crop management.","APR",2017

Despite urbanization being a major driver of land-use change globally, there have been few attempts to quantify and map ecosystem service provision at a city-wide scale. One service that is an increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies, and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage. 2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above-ground carbon stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom-up management of private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing top-down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city. 3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the above-ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3.16 kg C m(-2) of urban area, with 97.3% of this carbon pool being associated with trees rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation. 4. Domestic gardens store just 0.76 kg C m(-2), which is not significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0.14 kg C m(-2)). The greatest above-ground carbon density is 28.86 kg C m(-2), which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned/managed sites. 5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue Leicester's contribution by an order of magnitude. 6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city-wide scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing above-ground vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized European city.","OCT",2011

Therefore, this research aimed at providing distribution of the potential storage in soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) within the multifunctional landscapes of the Mo river basin in Togo. We (1) quantified the potential storages of SOC and TN under different land use/cover types, landscape positions, and land management regimes; and (2) highlighted the relationships among these soil chemical properties, in-situ ecological conditions, and other hypothesized controlling factors. We used soil data from 75 sample sites to determine the quantity of SOC and TN at two depths (0-10 cm and 10-30 cm). In-situ ecological variables were collected simultaneously during soil sampling. Spatial information on biophysical conditions of the study sites were obtained from satellite images and most updated global topographic and soil databases. The results showed that SOC and TN varied significantly according to land cover types, soil depths, topographical positions and land protection regime. Generally, forests and woodland contain highest SOC (4%) and TN (0.3%). Agricultural fields (fallowed and cultivating farms) exhibited the lowest values of SOC and TN, except in some selected farm sites where these chemicals are still high. Topsoil layer (0-10cm) contribute up to 60% of the total nutrient contents in soils. The sequential multivariate statistical approach unpacked and quantified the effects of inter-dependent ecological, management and landform drivers on the two important soil chemical properties (SOC and TN). The findings from this study could contribute to the improvement of national programme for assessing of greenhouse gases induced by land conversions. Based on this case-based finding in contextualization with related studies, we discussed on its implications for sustainable landscape restoration and climate change mitigation.

Understanding how a disturbance can propagate through an entire ecosystem and how induced changes can last after apparent recovery is key to guide management and ecosystem restoration strategies. Monitoring programs and impact assessment studies rely mostly on indicators based only on species relative abundance and biomass, potentially misinforming management efforts. Impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning, and subsequent delivery of ecosystem services, are too often overlooked. Here we use an ecosystem network approach to assess the recovery pathway and potential recovery debts of a coral reef ecosystem, following a pulse disturbance. We show that although species abundance and biomass indicators recovered in a decade after the perturbation, the ecosystem as a whole presented a recovery debt. The ecosystem structure lost complexity (became food chain like) and lost about 29% of its overall cycling efficiency and 9% of its transfer efficiency. Although the ecosystem trophic network in the fore reef may have maintained its general functioning, the ecosystem network in the lagoon, not directly exposed to the disturbance, presented a stronger recovery debt. Our results give new insights on how ecosystem network approaches can help identify ecosystem impacts and recovery pathways.","APR",2019

Next to ecological, socioeconomic and technical factors, the priorities of key actors in REDD+ implementation shape the integration of biodiversity concerns. This study aimed to identify the views of key actors in the REDD+ implementation process in Kenya with regard to biodiversity conservation and monitoring in order to evaluate the degree to which biodiversity is likely to be considered in the (sub-) national REDD+ context. In Kenya, avoided deforestation in dry forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in different forest types are major REDD+ activities. Interviews with 34 (sub-) national and project level actors showed that the solving of socioeconomic issues was paramount for REDD+ implementation in general and for achieving additional conservation benefits. In REDD+ initiatives in dry forests, conservation objectives were primarily related to wildlife; actors stressed the importance of specific management measures to minimize human-wildlife conflicts. In initiatives to enhance forest carbon stocks, the sustained provision of timber, fuel wood and hydrological ES was regarded as a conservation priority and a prerequisite for project viability. The biodiversity indicators and monitoring schemes considered to be available by the actors were mostly related to particular species. In conclusion, integration of biodiversity concerns into REDD+ depends heavily on the resolution of socioeconomic and political issues. Increased collaboration between Kenyan actors can contribute to the development of monitoring schemes for detecting REDD+ impacts on biodiversity and ES on a landscape scale.","DEC",2014

However, few studies have rigorously examined the effect of community restoration on biotic invasion resistance under conditions of controlled invader propagule pressure. Results are presented from a field experiment conducted in a post-agricultural grassland in eastern Kansas to explore the interplay of tallgrass prairie restoration and invader propagule pressure in modulating plant invasion. Seed additions of multiple native and non-native species were used to provide a general test of biotic invasion resistance under varied propagule availability. Restoration increased plant diversity, increased above ground productivity, reduced the availability of light, soil moisture and bare soil microsites and strongly suppressed the invasion of all species sown into the experiment, including the highly invasive exotic legume, Lespedeza cuneata. In the absence of restoration, L. cuneata rapidly dominated plots where it had been sown, particularly at the highest propagule pressure. Results of multiple regression modelling suggested that restoration most likely increased community resistance to L. cuneata invasion through changes in functional guild composition rather than through changes in species diversity. Overall our study indicates that restoration of abandoned agricultural land to native tallgrass prairie can enhance invasion resistance in the face of substantial invader propagule pressures by altering community composition to dominance by native species that are efficient in utilizing resources.","DEC",2015

These functionally important beetles are faced with a wide range of anthropogenic disturbances and changes in environmental conditions due to land use. We thus conducted quantitative surveys of the abundance (converted to total biomass) of dung beetles and their dung removal rates (g per two days) in 150 forest and 150 grassland sites with varying land-use intensity, located in north-east, central and south-west Germany. We used dung from livestock (cow, sheep, horse) and game animals (wild boar, red deer and fox) to provide a characteristic spectrum of dung resources on each site. Most dung beetle species showed habitat preferences: Anoplotrupes, Typhaeus and several Aphodius species almost exclusively occurred in forests, while most Onthophagus individuals were found in grasslands. In total we collected 18780 individuals from 33 species. The average dung beetle biomass was 36 times higher in forests than in grasslands, and their effective dung removal rate was 3 times increased. The beetles' total biomass was strongly correlated to their removal rates. In forests, the amount of wood harvesting significantly reduced dung removal rates by 20%, and mowing frequency (-7%) and fertilisation (-4%) had a significant negative effect in grasslands. Dung removal by beetles increased with grazing intensity (+6%), however, and was higher in non-native coniferous forests (+22%). Overall, our study demonstrates negative effects of habitat conversion from forest to grassland, and negative effects of land-use intensity within forests and grasslands on dung beetle activities.","43617",2017

Here, we applied a population model representing a freshwater amphipod feeding on leaf litter in forested streams. We simulated impacts of hypothetical stressors, individually and in pairwise combinations that target the individuals' feeding, maintenance, growth and reproduction. Impacts were quantified by examining responses at three levels of biological organisation: individual-level body sizes and cumulative reproduction, population-level abundance and biomass and ecosystem-level leaf litter decomposition. Interactive effects of multiple stressors at the individual level were mostly antagonistic, that is, less negative than expected. Most population- and ecosystem-level responses to multiple stressors were stronger than expected from an additive model, that is, synergistic. Our results suggest that across levels of biological organisation responses to multiple stressors are rarely only additive. We suggest methods for efficiently quantifying impacts of multiple stressors at different levels of biological organisation.","APR",2018

These included variables associated with the role that freshwater flows and biodiversity play in securing the system's capacity to sustain essential ecosystem services and their relationship with social demand for services, local water governance, and land-use intensification. Our results reveal the importance of considering the invisible dimensions of water and biodiversity, i.e. green freshwater flows and trait-based indicators, because of their relevance to the supply of ecosystem services. Furthermore, they uncover the importance of traditional irrigation canals, a local water governance system, in maintaining the ecosystems' capacity to supply services. The study also highlights the complex trade-offs that occur because of the spatial mismatch between ecosystem service supply (upstream) and ecosystem service demand (downstream) in watersheds. Finally, we found that land-use intensification generally resulted in losses of the biophysical factors that underpin the supply of some ecosystem services, increases in social demand for less diversified services, and the abandonment of local governance practices. Attempts to manage social-ecological systems toward sustainability at the local scale should identify the key biophysical and socio-cultural factors that are essential for maintaining ecosystem services and should recognize existing interrelationships between them. Land-use management should also take into account ecosystem service trade-offs and the consequences resulting from land-use intensification.",NA,2015

Ecological intensification aims to enhance crop productivity by including regulating and supporting ecosystem service management into agricultural practices. We investigate the potential for increased SOM to support the ecological intensification of arable systems by reducing the need for nitrogen fertiliser application and pest control. Using a large-scale European field trial implemented across 84 fields in 5 countries, we tested whether increased SOM (using soil organic carbon as a proxy) helps recover yield in the absence of conventional nitrogen fertiliser and whether this also supports crops less favourable to key aphid pests. Greater SOM increased yield by 10%, but did not offset nitrogen fertiliser application entirely, which improved yield by 30%. Crop pest responses depended on species: Metopolophium dirhodum were more abundant in fertilised plots with high crop biomass, and although population growth rates of Sitobion avenae were enhanced by nitrogen fertiliser application in a cage trial, field populations were not affected. We conclude that under increased SOM and reduced fertiliser application, pest pressure can be reduced, while partially compensating for yield deficits linked to fertiliser reduction. If the benefits of reduced fertiliser application and increased SOM are considered in a wider environmental context, then a yield cost may become acceptable. Maintaining or increasing SOM is critical for achieving ecological intensification of European cereal production.","NOV",2018

Despite the understanding that trees benefit urban ecosystems, there have been few studies that address the underlying physiology of different urban trees with regard to their capacity to take up water, particularly following rain events. We monitored the sap flow of nine species of trees in urban parks and linked sap flow to local microclimate. In addition, we measured throughfall, stemflow and crown architecture. Interspecific variation in sap flow was significant as were differences in time lags (i.e. difference in time between the increase of solar radiation versus sap flow) across species of large but not small trees. Interestingly the most important microclimatic drivers of sap flow were different in large versus small trees. Lastly, we found that trees with a large branch angle routed more rainwater to stemflow. In this study we found strong evidence that variation in urban tree physiology can impact important hydrological services that will influence the effectiveness of different trees as tools to manage stormwater runoff.","FEB",2018

Interference interactions, harassment and injury from larger carnivores may still pose a risk to smaller mesopredators. Foraging theory suggests that animals should adjust their behaviour accordingly to optimise foraging efficiency and overall fitness, trading off harvest rate with costs to fitness. The foraging behaviour of red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, was studied with automated cameras and a repeated measures giving-up density (GUD) experiment where olfactory risk cues were manipulated. In Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, red foxes increased GUDs by 34% and quitting harvest rates by 29% in response to wolf urine. In addition to leaving more food behind, foxes also responded to wolf urine by spending less time visiting food patches each day and altering their behaviour in order to compensate for the increased risk when foraging from patches. Thus, red foxes utilised olfaction to assess risk and experienced foraging costs due to the presence of a cue from gray wolves, Canis lupus. This study identifies behavioural mechanisms which may enable competing predators to coexist, and highlights the potential for additional ecosystem service pathways arising from the behaviour of large carnivores. Given the vulnerability of large carnivores to anthropogenic disturbance, a growing human population and intensifying resource consumption, it becomes increasingly important to understand ecological processes so that land can be managed appropriately.","JUL",2018

Neither densities and species richnesses of epifauna and infauna nor species composition varied significantly by vegetation type. Multivariate analyses of macrofaunal assemblage structure and abiotic/biotic environmental factors demonstrated that seagrass aboveground biomass explained a significant proportion of the multivariate variation in epifaunal species composition (39%); none of the potential explanatory variables was related to variation in ecological parameters of the infauna. Thus, seagrass specific identity is not a good predictor of either macrofaunal abundance or diversity patterns.

Driven by human activities, the luxury effect can potentially be found at a broader scale across different landscapes. Previously, the luxury effect relationship has been established within a city for two bat species, the red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and the evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis). We examined landscape-scale patterns of bat activity distribution-using empirical data for seven bat species for the luxury effect. We also identified bat-land cover associations for each species. Across North Carolina, USA, we used the mobile transect survey protocol of the North American Monitoring Program to record bat activity at 43 sites from 2015 to 2018. We collected land cover and income data at our transect locations to construct generalized linear mixed models to identify bat-land cover and bat-income relationships. Results We found that across landscapes, activity of the red bat and the evening bat was positively correlated to income independent of land cover, consistent with previous single-city results. We found a negative relationship between hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) activity and income. All seven species had specific land cover associations. Additionally, we found a positive interaction term between income and evergreen forest for the red bat and a positive interaction term between income and woody wetland for hoary bat. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the luxury effect is an ecological pattern that can be found at a broad spatial scale across different landscapes. We highlight the need for multi-scale ecology studies to identify the mechanism(s) underlying the luxury effect and that the luxury effect could cause inequity in how people receive the ecosystem services provided by bats.","43770",2019

Objectives Here we take an experimental approach to explore whether bird and bat exclusion affects pest control in sun coffee plantations, and whether this service is consistent at different spatial scales. Methods We experimentally excluded flying vertebrates from coffee plants in 32 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, encompassing a gradient of forest cover at landscape (2 km radius) and local (300 m) spatial scales, and quantified coffee leaf loss, as an indicator of herbivory, and fruit set. Results Leaf loss decreased with higher landscape forest cover, but this relation was significantly different between treatment and control plants depending on local forest cover. On the other hand, fruit set responded to the interaction between treatment and local forest cover but was not affected by landscape forest cover. More specifically, fruit set increased significantly with local forest cover in exclusion treatments and showed a non-significant decrease in open controls. Conclusions These results suggest that services provided by flying vertebrates are modulated by processes occurring at different spatial scales. We posit that in areas with high local forest cover flying vertebrates may establish negative interactions with predaceous arthropods (i.e. intraguild predation), but this would not be the case in areas with low local forest cover. We highlight the importance of employing a multi-scale analysis in systems where multiple species, which perceive the landscape differently, are providing ecosystem services.","SEP",2017

With this approach, we integrated the net primary production of vegetation, topography, soil, and climate variables to map and rank terrestrial ecosystems capacities to generate CNC. National nature reserves accounted for 6.7% of CNC-conservation priority areas across China. Considerable gaps (35.2%) existed between overall (or potential) CNC representativeness nationally and CNC representation in national reserves, and there was significant spatial heterogeneity of representativeness in CNC-conservation priority areas at the regional and provincial levels. For example, the best and worst representations were, respectively, 13.0% and 1.6% regionally and 28.9% and 0.0% provincially. Policy in China is transitioning toward the goal of an ecologically sustainable civilization. We identified CNC-conservation priority areas and conservation gaps and thus contribute to the policy goals of optimization of the national nature reserve network and the demarcation of areas critical to improving the representativeness and conservation of highly functioning areas of natural capital. Moreover, our method for assessing representation of CNC can be easily adapted to other large-scale networks of conservation areas because few data are needed, and our model is relatively simple.","AUG",2017

Most plastics arriving in the oceans were produced, used, and often disposed on land. Hence, it is within terrestrial systems that microplastics might first interact with biota eliciting ecologically relevant impacts. This article introduces the pervasive microplastic contamination as a potential agent of global change in terrestrial systems, highlights the physical and chemical nature of the respective observed effects, and discusses the broad toxicity of nanoplastics derived from plastic breakdown. Making relevant links to the fate of microplastics in aquatic continental systems, we here present new insights into the mechanisms of impacts on terrestrial geochemistry, the biophysical environment, and ecotoxicology. Broad changes in continental environments are possible even in particle-rich habitats such as soils. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that microplastics interact with terrestrial organisms that mediate essential ecosystem services and functions, such as soil dwelling invertebrates, terrestrial fungi, and plant-pollinators. Therefore, research is needed to clarify the terrestrial fate and effects of microplastics.

However, it is unclear whether the same bee species or genera will forage from one crop to the next, which bees specialize on particular crops, and to what degree inter-crop visitation patterns will be mediated by landscape context. We therefore studied local- and landscape-level drivers of bee diversity and species turnover in apple orchards, blueberry fields, and raspberry fields that bloom sequentially in southern Quebec, Canada. Despite the presence of high bee species turnover, orchards and small fruit fields complemented each other phenologically by supporting two bee genera essential to their pollination: mining bees (Andrena spp.) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). A number of bee species specialized on apple, blueberry, or raspberry blossoms, suggesting that all three crops could be used to promote regional bee diversity. Bee diversity (rarefied richness, wild bee abundance) was highest across crops in landscapes containing hedgerows, meadows, and suburban areas that provide ancillary nesting and floral resources throughout the spring and summer. Promoting phenological complementarity in floral resources at the farmstead and landscape scales is essential to sustaining diverse wild bee populations.","JUN",2018

However, we know little about how the stability of ecosystem services responds to landscape composition, and what ecological mechanisms underlie these trade-offs. Here, we develop a model to investigate the dynamics of three ecosystem services in intensively managed agroecosystems, i.e., pollination-independent crop yield, crop pollination, and biodiversity. Our model reveals trade-offs and synergies imposed by landscape composition that affect not only the magnitude but also the stability of ecosystem service delivery. Trade-offs involving crop pollination are strongly affected by the degree to which crops depend on pollination and by their relative requirement for pollinator densities. We show conditions for crop production to increase with biodiversity and decreasing crop area, reconciling farmers' profitability and biodiversity conservation. Our results further suggest that, for pollination-dependent crops, management strategies that focus on maximizing yield will often overlook its stability. Given that agriculture has become more pollination-dependent over time, it is essential to understand the mechanisms driving these trade-offs to ensure food security.","MAR",2019

Which traits and functional metrics mediate the impact of different types of land use on ecosystem function within and across trophic levels? \ Methods: We studied the functional relationships between plants and grasshoppers in sub-alpine grasslands under different management regimes in the Central French Alps. We applied the theoretical multitrophic response-effect framework described by (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, this issue) to identify key traits linking plants and grasshoppers to biomass production. The linkages between selected plant and grasshopper traits were analysed using community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and functional diversity (FD; Rao's quadratic diversity). Results: Uni-and multivariate models provided evidence about the relative importance of trait linkages within and across trophic levels. We showed that management affected both plant and grasshopper traits and that the interaction between themwas linked to biomass production. While a number ofCWMtraits and FD were involved in the interaction, CWM of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and grasshopper dry bodymass (GMass) chieflymediated the impact of management change on biomass production. Conclusions: Our study suggests that both trait values of the most abundant species and functional trait variation within and across trophic levels in combination may best explain the impact of land-use changes on ecosystem function. To improve ourmechanistic understanding across trophic levels, a better knowledge of response and effect traits remains a major goal, especially for animal ecologists, while a strong collaboration among disciplines is needed to bridge the existing gaps.","SEP",2013

At the same time, societal interest in reduced intensity management regimes is growing for a range of practical and normative reasons. We assessed if relative wild urban greenspaces, under little or no management, are associated with increased levels of biodiversity. We conducted a GIS-based relative wildness mapping for the Danish city Aarhus, and compared relative wildness to field-measured perceived biodiversity at 100 randomly placed sample sites in the city centre. Perceived biodiversity was estimated using the bioscore methodology. The results show a positive relationship between mapped wildness and bioscores, notably within artificial vegetated areas such as parks and gardens, while woodland had the highest wildness and bioscore values overall. All bioscore components measuring structural diversity increased with increasing mapped wildness. The bioscore component compositional richness covered site-level species richness for birds, invertebrates and plants, with invertebrate and bird species richness increasing and plant species richness decreasing with increasing wildness. The latter reflects that woodlands had low site-level plant diversity. Overall, woodlands nevertheless harboured many unique plant species, with woodlands and ruderal areas contributing the greatest beta diversity (inter-site variability in species composition). These findings show that urban greenspace management allowing for spontaneous ecological processes (greater wildness) overall also promotes urban biodiversity, pointing to potential synergies between urban design and management goals for reduced management intensity, increased wildness experiences, and higher biodiversity in urban greenspaces.","FEB",2018

Paulo state, Brazil. Using a high density functional gene array termed GeoChip 5.0, which contains 101,796 distinct probes belonging to gene categories involved in zinc transport, secondary metabolism, stress, virulence and nutrient cycling, differences were observed in the functional gene structure of microbial communities and abundance of specific gene families with a threshold between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1). However, the richness, diversity and evenness of functional genes did not differ across the zinc gradients in soil. Cluster analysis based on microbial functional subcategories revealed variation in abundances across the gradient of zinc concentrations in soil mainly for virulence, stress, secondary metabolism, and carbon- and phosphorus-cycling-related gene families. A threshold in abundance was observed between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1) with high abundance of microbial gene families associated with zinc transporter proteins, antioxidant enzymes, exoenzymes associated with infection, secretion proteins, virulence regulatory genes, carbon fixation, and phosphorus utilization in soils supplemented with up to 5 kg Zn ha(-1). In these same soils, reduced abundance was observed for gene families associated with methanogenesis, metabolism of halogen and carotenoid, and antiphagocytosis compared with soil supplements with 10 or 20 kg Zn ha(-1).

Using data from 67 arable fields, we examined whether the duration of adoption of in-field conservation agricultural practices (CA) and the landscape context of those arable fields explains the levels of in-field weed seed predation. Our results indicate that landscape and CA, in interaction, do indeed explain a large proportion of the observed variation in weed seed predation in-field.

Prior to this, carabid abundance was only high for fields in landscapes with high percentage cover of arable crops and/or permanent grassland.

Wetland plant communities may be especially susceptible to BH; however, this process has rarely been quantified and represents just one of many possible outcomes of compositional change. Likewise, few studies have used more than two timepoints to investigate BH as a dynamic temporal process. To address these issues, we quantified changes in -diversity amongst 48 herbaceous emergent wetlands across a landscape over four timepoints from 1997 to 2015. Pairwise occurrence- and abundance-based dissimilarity metrics were used to quantify -diversity. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to map these changes in compositional similarity through time, and repeated measures ANOVA via randomization was used to test for a significant effect of time on -diversity. Results indicated that herbaceous emergent wetlands homogenized in Illinois over 15years due to the increased presence and abundance of Phalaris arundinacea and the decline of several other species. Temporal dynamics of -diversity differed between occurrence- and abundance-based analyses. Synthesis. Using both presence-absence and abundance data to investigate BH helped avoid underestimating the impact of BH on -diversity, and drew attention to different temporal dynamics in -diversity at these two resolutions of community structure. This study highlights challenges associated with investigating BH, such as problems documenting the process where homogenization is not occurring in every site in a region, or where sites are converging towards more than one homogenized state. Incorporating concepts like alternative stable states may be helpful in resolving these issues, and present a more realistic picture of ecological change.","MAY",2018

We analyzed excluded and disturbed paired sites. We observed exclusion was effective in increasing seedling richness and occurrence of S. robusta and Syzygium cumini. A significant improvement in sapling strata (diversity, density, and richness) from excluding the disturbances was observed. Mean sapling density estimated was about 500% higher in excluded compared to disturbed sites. Probability of occurrence of S. robusta and Dalbergia latifolia saplings increased due to exclusion. That said, presence of exotic species Chromolaena odorata was higher in excluded sites reflecting the need for assisted natural regeneration in forests.

All perennial streams in the study have been surveyed for 5 main categories; ecological water quality, water quality for use, riparian integrity, riparian functionality, and riparian habitat potential. We found that a substantial amount of the streams in or close to urban areas had lost their functionality. Furthermore, around 10 percent of all streams in the peri-urban areas had been channelled.

For most of humanity, urban greenspace is the primary means by which someone can directly interact with nature in their daily lives. A key challenge is how to facilitate the active engagement of urban residents with that environment. Here, we examined the drivers of people's use of urban greenspaces in Tokyo, Japan. In an online questionnaire, participants (n = 1048) provided information on socio-demographics, frequency and duration of greenspace use in the prior 2 weeks, and the extent of their positive attitudes towards nature (nature orientation). We also measured the structure of the neighbourhood landscape surrounding each participant's home. The probability of greenspace use (i.e., whether an individual used it) was determined mainly by nature orientation, but also by the number of greenspaces around the home. Frequency and duration of greenspace use were positively associated with the number of vegetation types near the home and with individuals' nature orientation. Overall, our results showed that urban residents' use of neighbourhood greenspaces is driven by multiple landscape- and orientation-related factors. Thus, to reduce the extinction of experience, policy makers should not rely on a single management or policy approach but should combine various approaches in ways that will effectively promote people's direct nature experiences.","NOV",2019

These mechanisms can be organized into three general categories wherein water acts as (1) a resource or habitat for biota, (2) a vector for connectivity and exchange of energy, materials, and organisms, and (3) as an agent of geomorphic change and disturbance. These latter two roles are highlighted in current models, which emphasize hydrologic connectivity and geomorphic change as determinants of the spatial and temporal distributions of species and processes in river systems. Water availability, on the other hand, has received less attention as a driver of ecological pattern, despite the prevalence of intermittent streams, and strong potential for environmental change to alter the spatial extent of drying in many regions. Here we summarize long-term research from a Sonoran Desert watershed to illustrate how spatial patterns of ecosystem structure and functioning reflect shifts in the relative importance of different 'roles of water' across scales of drainage size. These roles are distributed and interact hierarchically in the landscape, and for the bulk of the drainage network it is the duration of water availability that represents the primary determinant of ecological processes. Only for the largest catchments, with the most permanent flow regimes, do flood-associated disturbances and hydrologic exchange emerge as important drivers of local dynamics. While desert basins represent an extreme case, the diversity of mechanisms by which the availability and flow of water influence ecosystem structure and functioning are general. Predicting how river ecosystems may respond to future environmental pressures will require clear understanding of how changes in the spatial extent and relative overlap of these different roles of water shape ecological patterns.","FEB",2013

E.","ECOSPHERE","Successful conservation of ecosystems and ecosystem services requires understanding the structural-functional relationships underlying resilience to disturbance pressures. State-and-transition models (STMs) are box-and-arrow diagrams conceptualizing system resilience, but many STMs lack functional descriptions. For a cattle-grazed sagebrush steppe ecosystem in northwestern Colorado, we aimed to update an existing STM by incorporating functional descriptions of the states to inform future hypotheses. In this STM, a diverse set of native perennial understory plants define a Diverse state, but long-term exclusion of disturbances to sagebrush results in a shift to a Depauperate state with increased bare ground interspaces and sagebrush dominance. We hypothesized that herbaceous species were inferior competitors to sagebrush over the long term for soil nitrogen. To examine evidence for this hypothesis, develop functional descriptions of the Diverse and Depauperate states, and identify more specific hypotheses for future studies, we measured the following: the mass, C:N, and distribution of the litter layer; nitrogen mineralization rates; nitrate pools; and soil attributes on plots classified as Diverse (n=5) or Depauperate (n=5). Plots in the Depauperate state had similar to 20% higher soil bulk density, half the clay and soil moisture concentrations, and 30% lower percent soil nitrogen compared to Diverse state plots; litter layer patchiness was nearly three times greater on the Depauperate plots than on the Diverse plots, but there was no significant difference between states in mean litter layer mass or C:N. We detected no significant differences between states in nitrogen mineralization rates or nitrate pools. This may be due to our sampling design, which examined nitrogen transformation at the plot level rather than at microsites within the plots, or it may be that another resource such as soil moisture is more limiting than nitrogen. Differences in soil texture between plots in the Diverse and Depauperate states may indirectly influence the competitive interactions between sagebrush and native herbaceous understory by controlling available soil resources. These results suggest that the vulnerability of sagebrush steppe ecosystems to state changes may be dependent on soil texture, which is highly variable across this broadly distributed ecosystem. Based on these insights, we present a revised STM and propose future work.","MAY",2018

This farm-scale study took place along a 1 km section of a headwater stream in southern Quebec (southeastern Canada). Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3. This study provides evidence that particular tree species/vegetation management treatment combinations strongly influence early riparian buffer structural development and soil NO3 dynamics in agricultural riparian zones.

However, how these drivers interact over long-time scales to affect underlying processes remains poorly understood, hindering our ability to predict their long-term consequences. Here, we use long-term data spanning nearly a century to investigate changes in hydrologic attributes for two lakes in the Upper Midwest with urbanizing watersheds. We quantified flashiness-the variability of runoff rate, volume, or stage-level of waterways-to investigate the concurrent impacts of urbanization and climate change on flashiness and flooding potential. Our results indicate that flashiness generally increased for both lakes over the period of 1916-2013, although this overall trend consists of sub-periods of increase and decrease. Increasing impervious surface area has been the stronger driver of flashiness historically; however, our results suggest that the impact of urbanization may reach a threshold, such that saturation effects would cause large magnitude precipitation events to become a relatively stronger driver of flashiness. Increasing flashiness indicates an increase in flooding potential, documented by increases in the 10- and 100-year flood threshold levels as large as 30 cm. Since flashiness is strongly related to the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services, the methodology and results presented here provide a unique approach to gain insight into how non-linear interactions between global change drivers, at multiple time scales, impact the simultaneous provision of multiple services.","APR",2017

Here we combine quantitative market surveys in Ghana and Benin with species distribution models (SDMs) to assess potential species' vulnerability to overharvesting and to prioritize areas for sustainable extraction studies. We provide the first detailed distribution maps for 12 commercially extracted medicinal plants in West Africa. We suggest an IUCN threat status for four forest species that were not previously assessed (Sphenocentrum jollyanum, Okoubaka aubrevillei, Entada gigas and Piper guineense), which have narrow distributions in West Africa and are extensively commercialized. As SDMs estimate the extent of suitable abiotic habitat conditions rather than population size per se, their output is of limited use to assess vulnerability for overharvesting of widely distributed species. Examples of such species are Khaya senegalensis and Securidaca longipedunculata, two trees that were reported by market vendors as becoming increasingly scarce in the wild. Field surveys should start in predicted suitable habitats closest to urban areas and main roads, as commercial extraction likely occurs at the shortest cost distance to the markets.

We developed a customised ecosystem model to evaluate the performance of alternative management scenarios at Puako in the provisioning of ecosystem services to human users (marine tourists, recreational fishers) and enhancing the reef's ability to recover from pressures (resilience). 3. Outcomes of the continuation of current management plus five alternative management scenarios were compared under both high and low coral-bleaching related mortality over a 15-year time span. 4. Current management is not adequate to prevent further declines in marine resources. Fishing effort is already above the multispecies sustainable yield, and, at its current level, will likely lead to a shift to algal-dominated reefs and greater abundance of undesirable fish species. Scenarios banning all gears other than line fishing, or prohibiting take of herbivorous fishes, were most effective at enhancing reef structure and resilience, dive tourism, and the recreational fishery. Allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders, with positive gains in both ecosystem resilience and dive tourism, while only moderately decreasing fishery value within the area. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our customised ecosystem model projects the impacts of multiple, simultaneous pressures on a reef ecosystem. Trade-offs of alternative approaches identified by local managers were quantified based on indicators for different ecosystem services (e.g. ecosystem resilience, recreation, food). This approach informs managers of potential conflicts among stakeholders and provides guidance on approaches that better balance conservation objectives and stake-holders' interests. Our results indicate that a combination of reducing land-based pollution and allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders and will enhance reef recovery from the detrimental effects of coral bleaching events that are expected over the next 15 years.","JUL",2018

Using interval regression to estimate willingness to pay, we find that there are respondents who will perceive mostly biodiversity benefits from restoration, with a particular interest in threatened species recovery.

The most important variables influencing the abundance and occurrence of snail species were the presence of predator and competitor, canopy cover, type of water body, waste dumping and water pH. In conclusion, snail species occurred less frequently and in smaller numbers in water bodies with minimal human disturbances.

Y.","APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH","Assessing the aquatic ecosystem health status of lakes has been the focus of lake studies for domestic and overseas researchers and water resource managers. Poyang Lake, which is one of the only two remaining large Yangtze-connected lakes in the middle reaches of Yangtze River in China, provides considerable ecosystem service functions, such as flood water storage, water supply for industrial and agricultural production, maintenance of the unique and diverse biota of the entire Yangtze floodplain ecosystem, maintenance of regional ecological balance and so on. However, due to the impact of climate change and human activities, Poyang Lake has experienced drastic hydrological changes, water quality decline and aquatic ecological function degradation in recent years. An assessment of the aquatic ecosystem health of Poyang Lake is of great importance. On the basis of the index system construction principles and a meta-analysis of previous research, this paper puts forward the index system for the ecosystem health assessment of Poyang Lake. The indices contains the three element layers of aquatic organisms, hydrologic characteristics and trophic status and the five indicators of ratio of cyanobacteria biomass to diatom biomass (CB/DB), diversity index of macrozoobenthos, lowest water level anomaly during the dry season, mean water level anomaly during rising season and trophic state index (TLI). Then, the thresholds of indicators are determined using empirical study, frequency analysis, standard specification and so on. Aquatic ecosystem health status is categorised into three groups: 'good', `moderate' and 'poor'. The study could provide theoretical basis for identifying the causes of the lake aquatic ecosystem health degeneration and protecting the environment of Poyang Lake. This present study provides an attempt to quantify the aquatic ecosystem health in a large floodplain lake with dramatic hydrological variations and will give some impetus for floodplain ecosystem assessment and management worldwide.",NA,2019

Under this climate change scenario, the development and improvement of restoration techniques will be required to cope with coral reef degradation. This study demonstrates the potential use of direct relocation of coral of opportunity as an effective long-term ecological restoration tool. We assessed coral growth parameters (cm yr(-1)), attachment rate (%), ecological volume (cm(3) yr(-1)), including long-term evaluation of annual live coral cover (%) and calcium carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) during 5-years (2013-2018) using resilient branching coral Pocillopora spp. The results show a survivorship of 67%, high self-attachment (100%) during the first 6-months, and size augmentation of similar to 167% in growth parameters (2.94-4.47 cm yr(-1)) and similar to 418% in ecological volume. Over the long-term, live coral cover increased from 13 to 28% ( + 4% per year) with an accumulated carbonate production of 14.53 kg CaCO3 m(-2) (similar to 3 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) resulting from the restoration process, and we found evidence for high resistance and recovery after periods of thermal anomalies. The data validate the use of direct propagation of corals of opportunity as a one of the most feasible and practical techniques to long-term restoration of damaged and degraded coral reef areas, which may help in their structural rehabilitation, improving coral communities and biodiversity maintenance.","MAR",2019

Several species of birds appear to be the primary reservoir hosts, whereas other bird species, as well as other vertebrate species, can be infected but are less competent reservoirs. One hypothesis regarding the transmission dynamics of West Nile virus suggests that high bird diversity reduces West Nile virus transmission because mosquito blood-meals are distributed across a wide range of bird species, many of which have low reservoir competence. One mechanism by which this hypothesis can operate is that high-diversity bird communities might have lower community-competence, defined as the sum of the product of each species' abundance and its reservoir competence index value. Additional hypotheses posit that West Nile virus transmission will be reduced when either: (1) abundance of mosquito vectors is low; or (2) human population density is low. We assessed these hypotheses at two spatial scales: a regional scale near Saint Louis, MO, and a national scale (continental USA). We found that prevalence of West Nile virus infection in mosquito vectors and in humans increased with decreasing bird diversity and with increasing reservoir competence of the bird community. Our results suggest that conservation of avian diversity might help ameliorate the current West Nile virus epidemic in the USA","JAN",2009

Here we focus on management, its ecological consequences, and social drivers. Our approach combined (1) quantitative surveys of local species diversity and abundance of three functional groups of ecosystem service providers (pollinators, seed dispersers, and insectivores) with (2) qualitative studies of local management practices connected to these services and their underlying social mechanisms, i.e., institutions, local ecological knowledge, and a sense of place. It focused on the ecology of three types of green areas (allotment gardens, cemeteries, and city parks) in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. These are superficially similar but differ considerably in their management. Effects of the different practices could be seen in the three functional groups, primarily as a higher abundance of pollinators in the informally managed allotment gardens and as differences in the composition of seed dispersers and insectivores. Thus, informal management, which is normally disregarded by planning authorities, is important for ecosystem services in the urban landscape. Furthermore, we suggest that informal management has an important secondary function: It may be crucial during periods of instability and change as it is argued to promote qualities with potential for adaptation. Allotment gardeners seem to be the most motivated managers, something that is reflected in their deeper knowledge and can be explained by a sense of place and management institutions. We propose that co-management would be one possible way to infuse the same positive qualities into all management and that improved information exchange between managers would be one further step toward ecologically functional urban landscapes.","JUL",2007

In California's Sierra Nevada foothills, ranchers frequently present the only defense against biological invasions in private rangelands. Although ranchers' land management goals (e.g., the desire to control invasive species) can be consistent with ecosystem protection, practical constraints often limit their success. Considerable research on the invasive weed, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.), has produced numerous control strategies. Nevertheless, the range of this noxious weed continues to increase. We used surveys and interviews to document the weed control efforts of 202 ranchers and to identify practical limitations to their efficacy. Overall, 86% of ranchers who had experienced yellow starthistle infestation had attempted control, using one or more of 19 methods. Early response reduced negative effects from yellow starthistle. Control methods learned from agricultural advisors were reported more effective than those learned elsewhere. Limitations to yellow starthistle control in our study population resulted from incomplete information regarding control methods, complexity of weed control in heterogeneous landscapes, inconsistent application of methods, and lack of long-term planning for weed control. Such hindrances make it difficult for landowners to implement control methods promoted by researchers. This gap between science and practice contributes to the continued increase of yellow starthistle within the study region. To shrink this gap, researchers and agricultural advisors can incorporate environmental heterogeneity into applied agricultural research, use land stewards' knowledge and experience, and increase public education.","JAN",2009

Species-rich communities often use resources more efficiently thereby improving community performance. However, high competition within diverse communities may also reduce community functioning. We manipulated the genotypic diversity of Pseudomonas fluorescens communities, a plant mutualistic species inhibiting pathogens. We measured antagonistic interactions in vitro, and related these interactions to bacterial community productivity (root colonisation) and ecosystem service (host plant protection). Antagonistic interactions increased disproportionally with species richness. Mutual poisoning between competitors lead to a negative complementarity effect, causing a decrease in bacterial density by up to 98% in diverse communities and a complete loss of plant protection. The results emphasize that antagonistic interactions may determine community functioning and cause negative biodiversityecosystem functioning relationships. Interference competition may thus be an additional key for predicting the dynamics and performance of natural assemblages and needs to be implemented in future biodiversity models.","MAY",2012

Of particular concern are the recent rapid changes occurring in coral reef systems.

Determining key attributes of future reef states is critical to reliably predict outcomes for ecosystem service provision. Here we explore the impacts of changing sponge dominance on coral reefs. Qualitative modelling of reef futures suggests that changing sponge dominance due to increased sponge abundance will have different outcomes for other trophic levels compared with increased sponge dominance as a result of declining coral abundance. By exploring uncertainty in the model outcomes we identify the need to (1) quantify changes in carbon flow through sponges, (2) determine the importance of food limitation for sponges, (3) assess the ubiquity of the recently described sponge loop, (4) determine the competitive relationships between sponges and other benthic taxa, particularly algae, and (5) understand how changing dominance of other organisms alters trophic pathways and energy flows through ecosystems.

In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) are implemented to enhance species richness and provision of ecosystem services, but the effectiveness of different AES types and the spatial extent of possible beneficial effects are little understood. In this study, we assessed the effects of different AES types on diversity, species traits and distance-decay functions of ground-dwelling predators in adjacent crop fields. On 31 study sites with winter oilseed rape (OSR) adjacent to four types of AES differing in management intensity and habitat age, we recorded ground-dwelling predators (carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and spiders) during OSR growth from April to July. Effects of the AES on species richness, activity densities and different traits of these taxa were examined with transects of pitfall traps running along a continuous distance gradient from the AES across the habitat border into the OSR fields. Ground-dwelling predator communities benefitted similarly from the different AES types. In adjacent OSR, activity densities, carabid species richness and the proportion of predatory carabid beetles declined from the field edge, while mean body size increased. Adjacent AES increased the proportion of predatory species and simultaneously decreased the proportion of granivorous or frugivorous species in adjacent OSR fields. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a beneficial effect of adjacent agri-environmental schemes (AES) on ground-dwelling predators in oilseed rape (OSR), mostly irrespective of agri-environmental schemes type and therefore management intensity and habitat age. The short-ranged distance-decay effects on natural enemies in oilseed rape underpin that a strategic spatial placement of agri-environmental schemes in agricultural landscapes is required to maximize biological pest control. This could help replace anthropogenic input in modern agriculture and secure adequate yields.","JAN",2019

We do so by focusing on regime shifts and cross-scale effects, described through the concepts of adaptive cycles and ecosystem services. Offshore wind farming is shown to lead to a potential slow regime shift in the marine ecosystem, as well as a more rapid regime shift in the seascape. These shifts lead to changes in the available ecosystem services and conflicts between new and traditional sea and seascape values.

This study evaluates whether theory and prior experiments adequately predict how stability varies with a measure of biodiversity, plant species richness, at multiple scales in naturally assembled ecosystems and assesses mechanisms through which biodiversity is proposed to affect stability. Location Chihuahuan desert. Historically, grasslands represented the dominant vegetation type in this landscape and shrubs were uncommon. Desertification has degraded many native grassland regions into one of several alternate states dominated by different shrub species and these regions differ in biodiversity. Methods Researchers at the Jornada long-term ecological research site have amassed 12 years of data on the primary productivity of individual plant species in 735 permanent 1-m2 plots distributed among 15 regions that were all historically grasslands. I used this information to describe the relationship between biodiversity and stability at the local (1?m2) and regional (3721?m2) scale and to evaluate mechanisms through which biodiversity is proposed to affect stability. Results At the local scale, ecosystem stability increased linearly with biodiversity while population stability tended to decline with biodiversity. At the regional scale, both ecosystem and population stability increased as a saturating function of biodiversity. Scale-dependent change in the biodiversitystability relationship can be explained by the spatial insurance hypothesis, asynchrony in the local productivity dynamics of the average species, and a change in species evenness with scale that weakens statistical averaging. Main conclusions Results from small-scale experimental studies may not directly translate to larger spatial scales but they appear to predict patterns in natural communities at small spatial scales. These results suggest that the maintenance of high biodiversity over a large spatial area is essential for maintaining ecosystem services and reducing the potential for further species extinctions.","JAN",2013

Carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation also were measured in a tidal forest (South Newport River) that experiences saltwater intrusion to evaluate the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion on C, N and P accumulation. Finally, soil accretion and accumulation of tidal forests were compared with tidal fresh, brackish and salt marsh vegetation downstream to gauge how tidal forests may respond to SLR. Soil accretion determined using C-137 and Pb-210 averaged 1.3 and 2.2 mm yr(-1), respectively, and was substantially lower than the recent rate of SLR along the Georgia coast (3.0 mm yr(-1)). Healthy tidal forest soils sequestered C (4982 g m(-2) yr(-1)), accumulated N (3.25.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and P (0.290.56 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and trapped mineral sediment (340650 g m(-2) yr(-1)). There was no difference in long-term accretion, C sequestration, and nutrient accumulation between healthy tidal forests and tidal forests of the South Newport River that experience saltwater intrusion. Accelerated SLR is likely to lead to decline of tidal forests and expansion of oligohaline and brackish marshes where soil accretion exceeds the current rate of SLR. Conversion of tidal forest to marshes will lead to an increase in the delivery of some ecosystem services such as C sequestration and sediment trapping, but at the expense of other services (e.g. denitrification, migratory songbird habitat). As sea level rises in response to global warming, tidal forests and their delivery of ecosystem services face a tenuous future unless they can migrate upriver, and that is unlikely in most areas because of topographic constraints and increasing urbanization of the coastal zone.","DEC",2012

We then explore mechanisms of community assembly by determining whether rare, large, or high-biomass species are more likely to persist in the larger microcosms. Our results indicate that larger areas harbor more rare species of a wider range of body sizes and have higher functional diversity, implying that the addition of niche space that supports rare species underlies the effect of area on species richness and function.

Upstream solutions to prevent their impact, including their detection, are needed. Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant living in vagile supercolonies, is especially hard to track and is a major threat for tropical ecosystems and local animal communities. As part of such tropical communities, crickets are sensitive to ecological conditions, easy to collect, detectable and identifiable through their species-specific calls. Here, we evaluated the use of an acoustic community of crickets as an indicator of the presence of W. auropunctata in New Caledonia. We evaluated the dominance of the crickets in the soundscape, describe the cricket community structure and diversity along a shrubland to forest gradient, characterize these cricket communities structure and diversity in the light of ongoing invasion by W. auropunctata, and identify cricket species' indicators of the invasion. Acoustic recordings collected on 24 sites were described using humanlistening and spectrographic visualization. The results demonstrated a clear dominance of the cricket group in the New Caledonian nocturnal soundscapes. Each habitat harbored a specific acoustic cricket community related to specific environmental attributes including vegetation height, daily variation of humidity and temperature. The presence of W. auropunctata was significantly associated with a lower cricket acoustic activity and species richness at night. Of the 19 species detected, four nocturnal species were identified as indicator of non-invaded forests and preforests. This work supports the use of acoustic as an alternative method to detect invasion.","MAY",2018

However, these experiments have rarely accounted for common ecological patterns, most notably skewed species abundance distributions and non-random extinction risks, making it difficult to know whether experimental results can be scaled up to larger, less manipulated systems. In contrast with the prolific body of experimental research, few studies have examined how species richness affects the stability of ecosystem services at more realistic, landscape scales. The paucity of these studies is due in part to a lack of analytical methods that are suitable for the correlative structure of ecological data. A recently developed method, based on the Price equation from evolutionary biology, helps resolve this knowledge gap by partitioning the effect of biodiversity into three components: richness, composition, and abundance. Here, we build on previous work and present the first derivation of the Price equation suitable for analyzing temporal variance of ecosystem services. We applied our new derivation to understand the temporal variance of crop pollination services in two study systems (watermelon and blueberry) in the mid-Atlantic United States. In both systems, but especially in the watermelon system, the stronger driver of temporal variance of ecosystem services was fluctuations in the abundance of common bee species, which were present at nearly all sites regardless of species richness. In contrast, temporal variance of ecosystem services was less affected by differences in species richness, because lost and gained species were rare. Thus, the findings from our more realistic landscapes differ qualitatively from the findings of biodiversity-stability experiments.","JUL",2017

In biological control, prevalence of selection effects supports augmentation of the most effective natural enemy, but complementarity effects support augmentation of natural enemy diversity. Optimization of biological control strategies from the results of diversity-function studies is limited because few consider changes in function with relative or absolute changes in abundance, and many confound the relative importance of richness and density through experimental designs ( additive and substitutive). By manipulating species richness across an abundance gradient we show that effects of species richness are density dependent and indicate how this may be incorporated into experimental designs or models predicting resource consumption in diverse communities. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms causing an observed diversity-function response, and its associated variation, changed across the richness-abundance gradient.

However, the use of hotspots has not often incorporated important habitat types, ecosystem services, anthropogenic activity, or consistency in identifying important conservation areas. The purpose of this study was to identify hotspots to improve avian conservation efforts for Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the state of Idaho, United States. We evaluated multiple approaches to define hotspots and used a unique approach based on weighting species by their distribution size and conservation status to identify hotspot areas. All hotspot approaches identified bodies of water (Bear Lake, Grays Lake, and American Falls Reservoir) as important hotspots for Idaho avian SGCN, but we found that the weighted approach produced more congruent hotspot areas when compared to other hotspot approaches. To incorporate anthropogenic activity into hotspot analysis, we grouped species based on their sensitivity to specific human threats (i.e., urban development, agriculture, fire suppression, grazing, roads, and logging) and identified ecological sections within Idaho that may require specific conservation actions to address these human threats using the weighted approach. The Snake River Basalts and Overthrust Mountains ecological sections were important areas for potential implementation of conservation actions to conserve biodiversity. Our approach to identifying hotspots may be useful as part of a larger conservation strategy to aid land managers or local governments in applying conservation actions on the ground.","SPR",2010

What are the consequences of these fire tolerances for savannaforest dynamics and landscape management? Location Anthropogenic savannas in the New Caledonian biodiversity hotspot (SW Pacific). Methods We estimated the range of fire intensity in New Caledonian savannas using field survey of fuels and the BehavePlus fire behaviour model. Within the predicted range of fire line intensity, we assessed theoretical fire injury to the cambium and crown for 11 species: the dominant tree of New Caledonian savannas (Melaleuca quinquenervia) and early secondary successional forest species. Using empirical models, for each species we estimated cambium damage from depth of necrosis (as a function of fire line intensity and fire residence time) and bark thickness, and crown damage from scorch height (as a function of fire line intensity) and tree height. We compared bark thickness and tree height increment patterns among species as well as species potential fire tolerance. Results The 11 species had very contrasting capacity to avoid fire injury to the bole cambium due to differences in bark investment patterns, but were all very exposed to scorching and crown injury. Overall, most of sampled individuals are likely top-killed by low intensity fires (<1000 kW.m-1), which are frequent according to our simulations. Conclusions The early secondary successional forest species growing in New Caledonian savannas are poorly adapted to fire, in comparison with literature on worldwide trees in savannas. As a result, their juveniles are unlikely to reach adult size in fire-prone areas. Restoration using the most fire-tolerant species and fire prevention may be complementary strategies to manage such tropical landscapes in order to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.","JAN",2013

High islands are subjected to constant erosion over geologic time, which establishes an important source of terrigeneous sediment for nearby marine communities. Many of these sediments are deposited in mangrove forests and offer mangroves a potentially important means for adjusting surface elevation with rising sea level. In this study, we investigated sedimentation and elevation dynamics of mangrove forests in three hydrogeomorphic settings on the islands of Kosrae and Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Surface accretion rates ranged from 2.9 to 20.8 mm y(-1), and are high for naturally occurring mangroves. Although mangrove forests in Micronesian high islands appear to have a strong capacity to offset elevation losses by way of sedimentation, elevation change over 6 years ranged from -3.2 to 4.1 mm y(-1), depending on the location. Mangrove surface elevation change also varied by hydrogeomorphic setting and river, and suggested differential, and not uniformly bleak, susceptibilities among Pacific high island mangroves to sea-level rise. Fringe, riverine, and interior settings registered elevation changes of -1.30, 0.46, and 1.56 mm y-1, respectively, with the greatest elevation deficit (-3.2 mm y(-1)) from a fringe zone on Pohnpei and the highest rate of elevation gain (4.1 mm y(-1)) from an interior zone on Kosrae. Relative to sea-level rise estimates for FSM (0.8-1.8 mm y(-1)) and assuming a consistent linear trend in these estimates, soil elevations in mangroves on Kosrae and Pohnpei are experiencing between an annual deficit of 4.95 mm and an annual surplus of 3.28 mm. Although natural disturbances are important in mediating elevation gain in some situations, constant allochthonous sediment deposition probably matters most on these Pacific high islands, and is especially helpful in certain hydrogeomorphic zones. Fringe mangrove forests are most susceptible to sea-level rise, such that protection of these outer zones from anthropogenic disturbances ( for example, harvesting) may slow the rate at which these zones convert to open water.","JAN",2010

Though nature conservation areas, such as Austria's national parks, serve as retreat habitats for a broad range of biota, they are embedded in a complex of landscapes where diverse conflicts of interests meet, for instance tourism, agriculture and nature conservation. As a first step to improving the multifunctional quality of landscapes in terms of connectivity and flows of energy, material and information across the boundaries of protected zones, the status quo of such landscape mosaics has to be evaluated. The main aim of this study was to test if protected areas generally supply a higher share of environment-related ecosystem services than the surrounding landscape. We also investigated to which extent the structural composition and configuration of landscape sections reflects their volume of ecosystem service provision. We selected our study sites within the Austrian-Hungarian transnational study region around Lake Neusiedl and developed a methodological framework for assessing and mapping ecosystem services based on expert knowledge, spatial information and field data. The crucial linkage between landscape structure and its contribution for sustaining distinct ecological key functions was investigated through comprehensive use of landscape metrics, habitat and connectivity mapping. We were able to verify that levels of ecosystem service provision as well as the share and function of ecologically viable landscape elements were higher within the national park and that a statistical correlation between the aforementioned assessments exists. The outcomes of this study may support local stakeholders with valuable information on the service provision capacity and functional state inside and outside protected landscapes and illustrate hot and cold spots of network patterns. This in turn will allow the development of well-focused and efficient planning measures to strengthen ecosystematic functioning in terms of sustainable landscape development vis-a-vis society.","JUL",2014

Yet several studies have proposed that these ecosystem services may be reduced where agricultural systems are more intensively managed. Here we investigate the predatory ability of twig-nesting ants on the main pest of coffee, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) under different management systems in southwest Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted both laboratory and field experiments to examine which twig-nesting ant species, if any, can prey on free-living borers or can remove borers embedded in coffee fruits and whether the effects of the twig-nesting ant community differ with habitat type. Results indicate that several species of twig-nesting ants are effective predators of both free-living borers and those embedded in coffee fruits. In the lab, Pseudomyrmex ejectus, Pseudomyrmex simplex, and Pseudomyrmex PSW-53 effectively removed free-living and embedded borers. In the field, abundance, but not diversity, of twig-nesting ant colonies was influenced by shade management techniques, with the highest colony abundance present in the sites where shade trees were recently pruned. However, borer removal rates in the field were significant only in the shadiest site, but not in more intensively managed sites. This study provides evidence that twig-nesting ants can act as predators of the coffee berry borer and that the presence of twig-nesting ants may not be strongly linked to shade management intensity, as has been suggested for other arthropod predators of the borer.","MAY",2010

The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation).

M.","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","Aim: Anthropogenic landscape change, such as urbanization, can affect community structure and ecological interactions. Furthermore, changes in ambient temperature and resource availability due to urbanization may affect migratory and non-migratory species differently. However, the response of migratory species to urbanization is poorly investigated, and knowledge for invertebrates in particular is lacking. Our aim was to investigate whether there was a shift in community structure and phenology of hoverflies in urban landscapes, depending on migratory status. Location: Switzerland. Methods: Using a paired design, we compared urban and rural landscapes to investigate the impact of urbanization on the abundance, diversity and phenology of hoverflies. Furthermore, we tested whether migratory and non-migratory species responded differently to urbanization. Results: We observed a difference in the response of migratory and non-migratory hoverfly communities. Although the abundance of hoverflies was higher in the rural ecosystem, driven by a high abundance of migratory species, there was no difference in species richness between the land use types. However, the community structure of non-migratory species was significantly different between urban and rural ecosystems. The phenology of hoverflies differed between the two ecosystems, with an earlier appearance in the year of migratory species in urban landscapes. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the response of migratory insect communities to urbanization. We demonstrated that migratory and non-migratory hoverflies respond differently to urbanization. This highlights the importance of differentiating between trait and mobility groups to understand community assemblage patterns in anthropogenic landscapes. The differences in phenology supports the growing evidence that urbanization not only affects the phenology of vegetation, but also affects the higher trophic levels. Changes in the phenology and community composition of species as a result of anthropogenic landscape change may have important implications for the maintenance of key ecosystem functions, such as pollination.","JUL",2018

However, ecologists rarely test the attractiveness of chosen plants to pollinators in the field. Here, we experimentally test whether plant species roles in pollination networks can be used to identify species with the most potential to recover plant-pollinator communities. Using published pollination networks, we calculated each plant's centrality and chose five central and five peripheral plant species for introduction into replicate experimental plots. Flower visitation by pollinators was recorded in each plot and we tested the impact of introduced central and peripheral plant species on the pollinator and resident plant communities and on network structure. We found that the introduction of central plant species attracted a higher richness and abundance of pollinators than the introduction of peripheral species, and that the introduced central plant species occupied the most important network roles. The high attractiveness of central species to pollinators, however, did not negatively affect visitation to resident plant species by pollinators. We also found that the introduction of central plant species did not affect network structure, while networks with introduced peripheral species had lower centralisation and interaction evenness than networks with introduced central species. To our knowledge, this is the first time species network roles have been tested in a field experiment. Given that most restoration projects start at the plant community, being able to identify the plants with the highest potential to restore community structure and functioning should be a key goal for ecological restoration.","OCT",2019

Our capacity to ensure the provision of ecosystem services (ES), the sustainability of agroecosystems and the efficiency of agri-environmental schemes (AES) relies on this knowledge. There is growing interest in how biodiversity and ES are affected by the interplay between landscape characteristics and agricultural management (e.g., intermediate landscape complexity hypothesis; ILCH). However, studies have typically focused on classical measures of community structure (e.g., species abundance, richness and biodiversity), tending to neglect the effects on the structure and stability of ecological networks and the increased risk of biotic homogenization (i.e., loss of beta-diversity). In this work, we use bee trap nests to sample pollen-solitary bee mutualistic networks in 9 pairs of olive groves under different management regimes (conventional vs. organic) in a landscape complexity gradient in southern Spain. We analyse the mutualistic networks at farm level to test the ILCH and study how agricultural practices and landscape complexity interact to affect the properties of these networks. We also explore the effects on spatial biotic homogenization by performing multivariate analyses of the composition and abundance of bee-plant communities and their pairwise interactions. The results show that solitary bee-plant networks have greater complexity and stability on organic olive farms embedded in relatively heterogeneous landscapes. Differences from conventional management were higher in landscapes of intermediate complexity but were non-significant on olive farms located in simpler landscapes. beta-diversity of bees, plants and their pairwise interactions was also greater on organic olive farms. In conclusion, human-induced environmental heterogeneity interacts at different scales to shape plant-solitary bee networks in olive groves, which may have important implications for ES provision and the effectiveness of agri-environmental measures.

Where mechanisms to pay for ES exist, they may serve as incentives to embark on habitat restoration projects. We evaluated the potential of newly established carbon markets in the United States to incentivize afforestation along riparian corridors, by comparing the income earnable by carbon offset credits with the costs of planting, maintaining, and registering such a restoration project in California. We used a 20-year chronosequence of riparian forest sites along the Sacramento River as our model project. We found that carbon credits can repay more than 100% of costs after two decades of regrowth, if sufficient effort is put into sampling intensity in the first post-restoration decade. However, carbon credits alone are unlikely to entice landowners currently engaged in agricultural activities to switch from farming crops to farming habitat.","JAN",2015

O.; Bocz, R.; Polyak, L.; Horvath, G.; Lengyel, S.","ANIMAL CONSERVATION","Ecosystem/habitat restoration has become a major goal of international biodiversity policy. However, restorations are often limited in space or time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal communities in the Egyek-Pusztakocs marsh system (Hortobagy National Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale, management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on abundance. Our results show that management is more important than restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.","OCT",2015

Estimates of genetic diversity, mating system parameters and reproductive output (capsule width, capsule height, capsule volume [capsule width by capsule height], number of seeds per capsule or seed viability) were similar between restored and remnant populations. There was no evidence of genetic bottleneck effects in restored populations and allelic differentiation between restored and remnant populations at each site was low (D-ST <= 0.055).

Changed hydrology, poor stormwater quality, and the modification of water bodies associated with urban development brings challenges for maintaining ecosystem services provision in an urban aquatic SES. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) has emerged as a form of development that aims to better support the provision of ecosystem services. Resilience concepts provide a basis for discriminating between WSUD and conventional development approaches. Building on an existing decision support system, a new, preliminary method for assessing resilience based on the combination of the socio-technical capacity (STC) and natural capacity (NC) of urban aquatic SESs has been developed. The STC score reflects a multicriteria assessment of the characteristics of stormwater infrastructure and management. The NC score reflects an assessment of the state and trajectory of biophysical attributes of the system associated with the provision of ecosystem services. By modeling a series of future urban development scenarios in Auckland, New Zealand, the method has been shown to discriminate between scenario outcomes within constraints associated with the biophysical and built characteristics modeled. Results are consistent with key concepts of resilience theory: outcomes are grouped in regimes and exhibit hysteresis, with the ability of WSUD to improve the state of the system strongly influenced by the presence of legacy effects. The method provides a source of additional, valuable information that complements other indicators by providing a snapshot of the interaction of catchment management effort and outcomes and indicating the likely future state of the SES. Recognizing that the method is limited to providing a relative assessment of resilience and adopts certain simplistic assumptions, further research aims to investigate assessment methods that consider other, fundamental biophysical and social properties of urban aquatic SESs.",NA,2017

These stressors may interact with unexpected consequences, as invasive species that require an initial environmental disturbance to become established can subsequently become important drivers of ecological change. There is recent evidence that improved bottom-water oxygen conditions in coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea coincide with increased abundances of the invasive polychaetes Marenzelleria spp. Using a reactive-transport model, we demonstrate that the long-term bioirrigation activities of dense Marenzelleria populations have a major impact on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics. This may facilitate the switch from a seasonally hypoxic system back to a normoxic system by reducing the potential for sediment-induced eutrophication in the upper water column. In contrast to short-term laboratory experiments, our simulations, which cover a 10-year period, show that Marenzelleria has the potential to enhance long-term phosphorus retention in muddy sediments. Over time bioirrigation leads to a substantial increase in the iron-bound phosphorus content of sediments while reducing the concentration of labile organic carbon. As surface sediments are maintained oxic, iron oxyhydroxides are able to persist and age into more refractory forms. The model illustrates mechanisms through which Marenzelleria can act as a driver of ecological change, although hypoxic disturbance or natural population declines in native species may be needed for them to initially become established. Invasive species are generally considered to have a negative impact; however, we show here that one of the main recent invaders in the Baltic Sea may provide important ecosystem services. This may be of particular importance in low-diversity systems, where disturbances may dramatically alter ecosystem services due to low functional redundancy. Thus, an environmental problem in one region may be either exacerbated or alleviated by a single species from another region, with potentially ecosystem-wide consequences.","FEB",2012

We also assessed precipitation variability at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) - located at the desert's ecological boundary using daily data from a recent 10-year period. Evaluating precipitation at these locations allows for comparison of precipitation variability between ecologically-stable ecoregions and the less-stable boundaries where ecological change may be more likely to occur. Regional data from 1910 to 2010 show an increase in the number of precipitation events, a decrease in their magnitude, and also an increase in the length of extreme periods with and without precipitation. At the SNWR, total precipitation is influenced by a small number of large events, while the majority of events (65%) have an insignificant effect. These analyses suggest that local variability in precipitation may be greater than is often attributed to the summer monsoon, and the difference between wet and dry monsoons depends on the occurrence of a small number of large events.

However, the variety of cropping systems creates a particular kind of heterogeneity which can strongly affect the diversity of species living in agro-ecosystems, and consequently the ecosystem services they provide. In this study, we investigate the effects of landscape composition and configuration of organic and conventional farming practices on three groups of aphids' natural enemies, compared to field habitat quality and land cover heterogeneity. A field survey was carried out in 2012 and 2013 in western France (Brittany). Ladybirds, carabid beetles and parasitoids were sampled in 40 pairs of organic and conventional winter wheat fields, distributed along a landscape gradient of organic farming areas. The relationships between farming practices and natural enemies were investigated with a PLS-path modeling approach, hardly ever used in ecology but presenting numerous advantages to analyze multivariate systems. Results showed that abundance and species richness of natural enemies were mainly affected by local farming practices, with a higher diversity in organic fields. To a lesser extent, landscapes also affected natural enemies, but only in relation to the length and configuration of hedgerows. Our results open up avenues for the design of agricultural landscapes since our results suggest that natural enemy diversity can be enhanced without a specific organization of organic fields. We discuss methodological issues regarding the description and the analysis of farming practices at the landscape scale. We argue that such investigations require high quality maps covering large spatial extents, and the use of statistical tools providing a good handling of complex relationships occurring in agro-ecosystems.","JAN",2015

Our study was undertaken in one of the most important coffee-producing regions of Brazil, and comprised nine landscapes of sun coffee plantations surrounded by different amounts of Atlantic Forest remnants. Using floral exclusion experiments we evaluated fruit set in 15 coffee shrubs per landscape. We also sampled the bees visiting coffee flowers. Our analyses were made at two landscape scales, with 1 and 2 km radii, and one shrub scale, with 300 m radius around each coffee shrub. We collected 241 bee individuals and identified a total of 22 species. The honeybee Apis mellifera (Apini) was the most abundant flower visitor followed by Trigona spinipes (Meliponini). Native bee abundance, richness and diversity were positively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. Honeybee abundance, on the other hand, was negatively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. The presence of bees resulted in an increase in coffee fruit set of 28%. A. mellifera abundance positively affected fruit set across spatial scales, while the composition of the native bee community affected fruit set differently at the landscape scales than at the shrub scale. Our work shows that bee pollination services are affected by landscape structure at different spatial scales. These findings can be used in conservation and agricultural planning to maximize crop production while safeguarding biodiversity and the provision of pollination services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Urban forest ecosystems confer multiple ecosystem services. There is therefore a need to quantify ecological characteristics in terms of community structure and composition so that benefits can be better understood in ecosystem service models. Efficient sampling and monitoring methods are crucial in this process. 2. Full tree inventories are scarce due to time and financial constraints, thus a variety of sampling methods exist. Modern vegetation surveys increasingly use a stratified-random plot-based sampling to reduce the bias associated with convenience sampling, even though the latter can save time and increase species richness scores. The urban landscape, with a high degree of conspecific clustering and high species diversity, provides a unique biogeographical case for comparing these two methodological approaches. 3. We use two spatially extensive convenience samples of the urban forest of Meran (Italy), and compare the community structure, tree characteristics and ecosystem service provision with 200 random circular plots. 4. The convenience sampling resulted in a higher species diversity, incorporating more rare species. This is a result of covering more area per unit sampling time. Pseudorandom subplots were compared to the random plots revealing similar Shannon diversity and sampling comparability indices. Measured tree variables (diameter at breast height, height, tree-crown width, height to crown base) were similar between the two methods, as were ecosystem service model outputs. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that convenience sampling may be a time and money saving alternative to random sampling as long as stratification by land-use type is incorporated into the design. The higher species richness can potentially improve the accuracy of urban ecological models, which rely on species-specific functional traits.","SEP",2018

Elizabeth","NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","Boreal forests represent the world's largest terrestrial biome and provide ecosystem services of global importance. Highly imperilled by climate change, these forests host Earth's greatest phylogenetic diversity of endophytes, a hyperdiverse group of symbionts that are defined by their occurrence within living, symptomless plant and lichen tissues. Endophytes shape the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of plants and are therefore key to the function and resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. A critical step in linking the ecological functions of endophytes with those of their hosts is to understand the distributions of these symbionts at the global scale; however, turnover in host taxa with geography and climate can confound insights into endophyte biogeography. As a result, global drivers of endophyte diversity and distributions are not known. Here, we leverage sampling from phylogenetically diverse boreal plants and lichens across North America and Eurasia to show that host filtering in distinctive environments, rather than turnover with geographical or environmental distance, is the main determinant of the community composition and diversity of endophytes. We reveal the distinctiveness of boreal endophytes relative to soil fungi worldwide and endophytes from diverse temperate biomes, highlighting a high degree of global endemism. Overall, the distributions of endophytes are directly linked to the availability of compatible hosts, highlighting the role of biotic interactions in shaping fungal communities across large spatial scales, and the threat that climate change poses to biological diversity and function in the imperilled boreal realm.","OCT",2019

These habitats are subject to a variety of stressors, including the conversion of adjacent terrestrial habitats from forest to agriculture, but the impacts of these anthropogenic effects are largely unknown because of the paucity of studies in these systems. In montane habitats in the wet tropics, large-scale cultivation of tea is common and can represent an important source of income at local and national scales. However, little is known about how tea cultivation impacts adjacent stream ecosystems. In this study, we examine stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in a biodiversity hotspot the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Specifically, we compare diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages found on cobbles in stream riffles in watersheds dominated by forest with those surrounded by tea cultivation. We found that streams surrounded by tea were characterized by significantly lower dissolved oxygen and had lower total estimated species richness and number of families. Furthermore, the richness of invertebrate taxa known to be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance were substantially reduced in tea streams and general assemblage-level analysis shows significant differences in the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages between tea and forested streams. Our results suggest that tea cultivation may reduce stream habitat quality and biodiversity in the East Usambaras. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of tea cultivation on streams over longer times scales and to address methods for minimizing negative effects of agriculture on montane stream communities.","JUL",2009

To investigate the potential of small carnivores for the biological control of rodents within agro-ecosystems, we assessed both the ecological and social landscapes within two rural villages in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, South Africa. We employed a camera trapping survey underpinned by an occupancy modelling framework to distinguish between ecological and observation processes affecting small carnivore occupancy. We also used questionnaires to investigate perceptions of small carnivores and their role in pest control. We found the greatest diversity of small carnivores in land used for cropping in comparison to grazing or settlements. Probability of use by small carnivores was influenced negatively by the relative abundance of domestic dogs and positively by the relative abundance of livestock. Greater carnivore diversity and probability of use could be mediated through habitat heterogeneity, food abundance, or reduced competition from domestic carnivores. Village residents failed to appreciate the role of small carnivores in rodent control. Our results suggest that there is significant, although undervalued, potential for small carnivores to provide ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have not adequately considered the ability to fulfill people's demand for ecosystem services when identifying sources of LESP. To address this gap, we sought to develop a more comprehensive approach coupling ecosystem services supply and human ecological demand to construct LESP for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. We proposed a new evaluation framework integrating ecosystem services importance assessment and landscape connectivity analysis with human ecological demand importance assessment to identify ecological sources. Afterwards, ecological corridors were identified using Minimum Cumulative Resistance model based on sources and resistance surface modified through nighttime light data. Combined with ecological sources and corridors, LESP for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region can be constructed. The ecological sources are mainly located in western Beijing and southwestern Chengde. The ecological source area totals 36,245.50 km(2), accounting for 21.26% of the ecological land in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The ecological corridors cross the whole region, from northeast to southwest, similar to the direction of the Yanshan-Taihang Mountain Chain. All the national nature reserves and 91.4% of the provincial nature reserves are distributed within the LESP. The validity of our methodology is confirmed by the distribution of the nature reserves. This study adds new insights into the methodology of LESP construction, and its results provide information about local ecological characteristics that can provide an important reference for decision-making concerning urban planning and ecological conservation.","JUN",2017

This study used a set of quantitative surrogate biophysical indicators to map the capability of China's eleven ecoregions to provide four types of ESs (carbon capture, soil protection, water purification and provision, and habitat provision) from 2000 to 2010. The results revealed the spatial distribution patterns and time trends of the ESs of the eleven ecoregions in China. This study shows that: (1) the average annual total value of ESs provided from 2000 to 2010 increased from northwest to southeast, and in the Middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as well as over the entirety of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and South China ecoregions; (2) the temporal trends of annual total ESs from 2000 to 2010 showed increases in most ecoregions except those of northeast China and northern China, which experienced decreases; and (3) the surrogate biophysical method for mapping the spatial and temporal characteristics of ESs gives acceptable results, especially at large spatial scales, compared to research results obtained using more complex modeling approaches. Thus the simple surrogate approach is suitable for the rapid assessment and long-term dynamic surveillance of ESs at broad spatial scales, and for tasks such as priority setting or performance assessments for nature conservation and ecological restoration with ESs as key targets. The methodology is also suitable for land-use impact analysis and trade-off analysis concerning land-use decisions in terrestrial environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","MAY",2017

ES bundles (ESBs), which closely link ES trade-offs and synergies, provide a comprehensive approach to exploring the relationship between natural ecosystems and human well-being. In this study, we quantified eight ES in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural services using geographical data and other available information (both ecological and social) in the Pearl River Delta, China. We identified ESBs based on IC-means clustering and redundancy analysis. The results showed that spatial patterns of each ES were quite heterogeneous at watershed level. Provisioning services were mainly distributed in watersheds with high proportion of cultivated land and waterbody. Remote forest areas provided high regulating services. Moreover, densely populated urban areas provide high cultural services. Five ESBs were detected ranging from 2941 to 16,249 km(2). According to the Pearson correlations and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we detected the trade-offs between provisioning and cultural services, and between regulating and cultural services, and synergies happened within regulating services. Intensive land-use and management in urban areas contributed to ES trade-offs. These results provide deeper understanding of the relationship between ES and land-use type at watershed level and detailed guidelines for ecosystem management.","OCT",2018

A systems approach to maintaining natural resources focuses on how interactions and feedbacks among components of complex social-ecological systems generate social and ecological outcomes. In recreational fisheries, residential shoreline development and fish stocking are two widespread human behaviors that influence fisheries, yet emergent social-ecological outcomes from these potentially interacting behaviors remain under explored. We applied a social-ecological systems framework using a simulation model and empirical data to determine whether lakeshore development is likely to promote stocking through its adverse effects on coarse woody habitat and thereby also on survival of juvenile and adult fish. We demonstrate that high lakeshore development is likely to generate dependency of the ecosystem on the social system, in the form of stocking. Further, lakeshore development can interact with social-ecological processes to create deficits for state-level governments, which threatens the ability to fund further ecosystem subsidies. Our results highlight the value of a social-ecological framework for maintaining ecosystem services like recreational fisheries.","JAN",2017

However, knowledge about the impact of these measures on diversity components beyond species richness, especially for non-target species and their ecological functions, is still very poor. Here, we investigated the response of ground beetle communities to the conversion of arable land into flowering fields, which are primarily installed to counteract pollinator loss in agricultural landscapes. We are focusing on the relationship between biodiversity components and the evolutionary relationship among functional groups. Land-use conversion from arable land to flowering fields has changed the phylogenetic community composition of ground beetles towards a phylogenetically clustered community. This is due to an increase in closely related medium-sized herbivorous species and a decrease in evolutionarily distinct small carnivorous species. Phylogenetic clustering did not result in a reduction of functional richness, but it increased the number of unique trait combinations of species within the local communities. This suggests a low ecological redundancy among herbivorous species. Because species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were unaffected by conversion, phylogenetic community structuring was predominantly driven by species turnover rather than by numerical changes. Flowering fields can act as refuges for herbivorous carabids that potentially affect the surrounding agricultural landscape by providing important ecosystem services such as weed control. To understand the impact of habitat transformation on carabid biodiversity, it was more informative to relate response traits to phylogenic and functional diversity than to use single diversity measures such as species richness. This conclusion might also apply to many other taxa.","MAR",2019

Further focus on the mechanistic relationships among ESs and their underlying biophysical processes provides greater insight into the causes of variation and covariation among ESs, thus serving as a guide to enhance their supply while preventing adverse outcomes. Here, we used the U.S. Pacific Northwest coastal dune ecosystem to examine how invasive beachgrass management affects three ESs: coastal protection, western snowy plover conservation, and endemic foredune plant conservation. At seven coastal dune habitat restoration areas, we observed spatial variation in the supply of each ES and further identified a tradeoff between western snowy plover conservation and coastal protection. While the ESs were collectively influenced by the invasive beachgrasses and the foredunes they create, the magnitude of the synergies and tradeoffs were influenced by numerous non-shared drivers, including nearshore geomorphology, changes in foredune shape as a result of restoration, and other management actions irrespective of restoration. Incorporation of these shared and non-shared drivers into future coastal management planning may reduce tradeoffs among Pacific Northwest dune ESs. With better understanding of ES relationships, it becomes possible to identify management actions that may enhance synergies and mitigate tradeoffs, leading to better decisions for nature and people.","APR",2017

We quantified bird diversity and seed removal from 38 wild cherry trees (Prunus avium) along a human land-use gradient from forest to structurally diverse to simple agricultural systems. High human land-use intensity led to low species richness and total abundance of the local bird community around wild cherry trees, as expected from previous studies. Nevertheless, trees in structurally simple agroecosystems were visited as frequently as trees in structurally complex landscapes and in forests. Furthermore, the number of seeds removed per tree did not decline with increasing human land-use intensity. Thus, ecosystem function was robust in spite of locally reduced bird diversity. The reason might be that movement behaviour and movement distances of birds changed along the human land-use gradient. It appears that birds moved longer distances to forage in fruiting cherry trees in structurally simple agroecosystems. This suggests that for systems where ecosystem function is mediated by highly mobile organisms, movement behaviour and distances are of considerable importance. Increases in movement distances with increasing human land-use intensity might also be common in other systems in which ecosystem function depends on mobile links.","APR",2010

These models attempt to explain how disturbance regime, latitude, and trophic complexity are related to observed patterns of renewable emergy flows and storages and biodiversity. A prior hypothesis, which this work seeks to examine, suggests that as renewable emergy flow increases biodiversity will increase. In this regard, we simulate how H.T. Odum's original CLIMAX model, which tracks forest biomass and diversity over 100 years of succession, responds to a periodic disturbance. The static scenario model compares emergy flow, storage and diversity in five forest eco-regions along the east coast of the United States. An emergy flow matrix ecological network model was used to simulate biodiversity in a mature forest ecosystem and in a typical suburban forest system to investigate how the complexity of a forest system will affect emergy throughput. Comparisons were made for the Shannon diversity index and transformity at the individual trophic level. These comparisons seek to further our understanding of the relationship of emergy and biodiversity and to validate the use of renewable emergy flow to explain ecological phenomena (e.g., biodiversity increasing as latitude decreases, biodiversity increasing through the stages of forest succession).

In freshwaters, detritus decomposition is a major ecosystem service but it remains uncertain whether invasive alien decapods process detritus differently to natives. This study examined leaf litter processing, and cascading effects on biofilms, by the European native white clawed crayfish (Austropotatnobius pallipes) compared to two invasive alien decapod species: the American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Invasive alien decapods were responsible for higher leaf litter decomposition than the native. In comparison with native crayfish, invasive alien crab and crayfish showed higher rates of litter consumption, increased production of smaller leaf fragments, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and dissolved organic carbon. Nutrients (ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorous) derived from excretion (measured separately in the absence of biofilms) varied among decapod species, being lower for P. leniusculus. However, nutrient concentrations did not vary among species in the detritivory experiments with biofilm, implying nutrients were utilised for biofilm production and respiration as no differences in biomass were evident among decapod treatments. These results show invasive alien decapods have the potential to increase the magnitude of detrital processing to FPOM in rivers, but indirect impacts on primary producers due to nutrient release are uncertain based on this experimental context.","JUL",2018

Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, provide key ecosystem services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, combined anthropogenic activities and climatic change-driven sea level rise (SLR) pose a severe threat to their global persistence, and to the continued delivery of these services. Mangrove vulnerability to SLR depends upon capacity for both resilience (landward migration) and resistance (maintained functioning with the existing distribution), which are in turn hindered by extractive activities and coastal infrastructure development. Limited landscape-scale data availability means existing SLR vulnerability assessment frameworks lack rigorous quantification of these discrete processes. 2. Here we develop and implement a novel multi-product (multispectral, microwave, derived-product) open-access satellite remote sensing approach to assess both coastal ecosystem SLR resilience and resistance capacity in multiple mangrove sites across the world, and landscape-level and anthropogenic factors driving these capacities. Our approach allows comparative ranking of resilience and resistance capacities across sites, based on relative observed ecosystem change (biomass, distribution) and in constraints to these two components of SLR vulnerability. 3. We observe mostly low SLR resilience and resistance across our case study sites. Furthermore, we find that site-specific resilience and resistance capacities and constraints can be highly incongruent, highlighting the importance of comprehensive SLR vulnerability monitoring for effective management. High within-site variation was also detected in resilience and resistance capacities and their constraints. This underlines the importance of spatially explicit monitoring at extensive spatial scales to inform decision making. 4. The methodology developed and repeat-pass imagery employed adds to the remote monitoring and assessment toolkit for adaptive coastal ecosystem management under SLR, providing a new approach to inform conservation and management priority assessments in data-deficient regions.","AUG",2018

Pollination services in cacao farms can be enhanced through efforts to conserve pollinator habitats, such as adding cacao fruit husks underneath trees to provide habitat and food resources for midge pollinators. However, it remains unclear how this habitat manipulation affects pest densities or biological control. Here, we evaluated the effects of the predaceous ant Oecophylla smaragdina on three major pests of Australian cacao (Helopeltis spp., Amblypelta spp., and Rhyparida nitida) in an Australian cacao farm, in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. We also evaluated the effect of O.smaragdina on their potentially plant-damaging, mutualistic mealybug (Pseudococcidae) partners in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. Oecophylla smaragdina reduced the combined densities of Helopeltis spp. and Amblypelta spp., regardless of cacao fruit husk addition. The ants also reduced the densities of R.nitida in the absence of cacao fruit husks, but R.nitida densities were naturally low in the experimental plots that received the addition of cacao fruit husks, regardless of ant presence. In contrast, ants generally increased the densities of mealybugs. These data suggest that O.smaragdina ants provide pest control services for three major insect pests in Australian cacao farms. Furthermore, this control may be compatible with habitat manipulations (i.e., the addition of cacao fruit husks) to improve pollinator habitat.","MAY",2017

S. A. (Kris); Ouyang, Zhiyun","ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY","Introduction: Culturally protected forests (CPFs), preserved and managed by local people on the basis of traditional practices and beliefs, have social and ecological functions. Local residents' perceptions were investigated in three types of CPFs (community forests, ancestral temple forests, and cemetery forests) in five villages in southeast China. In semi-structured interviews (232 questionnaires), residents were asked about their perceptions concerning ecosystem services and protection of CPFs. Outcomes: The survey results showed that resource utilization was not high in CPFs than in forests without culturally protected. Important ecosystem services provided by CPFs included air quality improvement, water retention, recreation, and aesthetic value. Respondents were satisfied with different cultural services provided by CPFs, including aesthetic value of community forests, ecotourism of ancestral temple forests, and cultural heritage of cemetery forests. Informal rules and traditional customs were used as the main measures to govern forests in daily life; however, the most effective measures, in order of importance, were setting fines or punishment by laws, using informal rules and village regulations, or protection by government agencies. Only half of the respondents were willing to pay for maintaining ecosystem services of CPFs, but 77.8% respondents were willing to spend time on protection. From apolicy perspective, educational programs were as important as traditions, and they are crucial to explain the ecological importance of CPFs. Conclusion: The conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services of CPFs will benefit if government agencies consider incorporating CPFs into policy and legislative frameworks, maintain CPFs as collectively owned forests, and introduce ecological compensation mechanisms.","43801",2018

Promoting a more diverse mammalian herbivore community, including large and megaherbivores, may result in positive cascade effects for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, reintroducing an ecologically functional substitute of an extinct large herbivore could mitigate current biodiversity declines and foster semi-natural grassland conservation. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year rewilding experiment where 12 feral horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). We used community-weighted mean plant functional traits to elucidate plant community changes induced by grazing through time. We also investigated the effects of this experimental treatment on insect pollinated plants and on pollinator habitat use. The grassland community exerted a mixed tolerance/avoidance response to grazing. This resulted in plant functional compositional changes which favoured prostrate plant species with higher specific leaf area, characteristic of ruderal communities. Plant species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed areas. Butterfly and bumblebee habitat use, as well as feeding and resting activities were also higher in grazed areas. Moreover, the number of pollinators increased with plant species richness.Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of a given herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild horses can have significant effects on the functional composition of grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use.

The documented benefits of community gardens include food production, recreational opportunities, and a wide number of social benefits such as improving community stability, reducing crime, and physical and mental health benefits. While much of the literature cites community gardens as providing environmental benefits for cities, there is little empirical evidence of these benefits. Here we examine the stormwater runoff benefits of community gardens by comparing two methods to estimate absorption rates of stormwater runoff in urban community gardens of New York City. The first method uses general land cover classes as determined by a land cover dataset; the second methods adds a land cover specific to community gardens- raised beds, typically used for food production. We find that in addition to the stormwater mitigation performed by pervious surfaces within a garden site, community gardens in New York City may be retaining an additional 12 million gallons (similar to 45 million liters) of stormwater annually due to the widespread use of raised beds with compost as a soil amendment.","FEB",2017

The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices.","APR",2014

Masonry retaining and city walls offer unusual ruderal habitats for spontaneous establishment of unique plant communities which may flourish despite urban disturbance and intensification. We comprehensively surveyed the wall-plant communities in Chongqing in southwest China to investigate their special urban ecology and their role in sustaining urban biodiversity. From 289 masonry walls, we recorded 205 plant species under 164 genera and 78 families. Perennial and annual herbs were the most common growth forms by species number. Despite accommodating 27 tree species and 6538 tree individuals, three dominant ones, respectively two Moraceae members Ficus virens which is a strangler fig and Broussonetia papyrifera, and Robinia pseudoacacia (Leguminosae), constituted 94% of the wall-tree stock. Detailed analysis of tree height distribution shed light on species recruitment dynamics. The dispersal agents differentiated sharply by growth form, with 73% herbaceous species wind-dispersed in comparison with 70.2% woody species bird-dispersed. The endemism and floristic characteristics of wall-plant communities were influenced by the regional urban flora, particularly for dominant wall trees; similar traits were found in the wall flora of Nanjing and Hong Kong. The low similarity in species composition between walls and nearby ground plant communities suggested the critical role played by walls in protecting the disturbance-intolerant native plants, including many Pteridophytes. The conservation values and biodiversity contributions of masonry walls in Chongqing are worthy of special attention. The findings could provide the basis to maintain urban ecosystem services and for nature-based ecological urban designs.","NOV",2019

However, little is known about the consequences of these population explosions on ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally investigated how the population density of sika deer (Cervus nippon) in temperate deciduous forest areas in Japan affected the decomposition of mammal dung by dung beetles, which is a key process in forest ecosystems. We measured a range of environmental variables (e.g., vegetation cover, soil hardness) and the dung decomposition rate, measured as the amount of deer dung decomposed during one week, and sampled dung beetles at 16 study sites with three different deer densities (high/intermediate/low). We then used structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships between deer density, environmental variables, the biomass of dung beetles (classified into small or large species), and the dung decomposition rate. We found that the biomass of small species increased with increasing deer density, whereas that of large species was not related to deer density. Furthermore, the dung decomposition rate was positively related to the biomass of small species but unrelated to that of large species. Overall, our results showed that an increase in deer density affects the decomposition rate of mammal dung by changing the structure of dung beetle communities (i.e., increasing the number of small dung beetles). Such an understanding of how increases in large herbivore populations affect ecosystem functions is important for accurately evaluating the ecological consequences of their overabundance and ultimately managing their populations appropriately.","APR",2018

Depending on whether the traits of colonizers are complementary or redundant to the assemblage, species gains can increase the efficiency or stability of ecological functions, yet detecting these processes is not straightforward. We propose a new conceptual model to identify potential changes to complementarity and redundancy in response to landscape change via relative changes in taxonomic and functional richness. We applied our model to a 14-year study of birds across an extensive agricultural region. We found compelling evidence that high levels of landscape-scale tree cover and patch-scale restoration were significant determinants of functional change in the overall bird assemblage. This was true for every one of the six traits investigated individually, indicating increased trait-specific functional complementarity and redundancy in the assemblage. Applying our conceptual model to species diversity data provided new insights into how the return of vertebrates to restored landscapes may affect ecological function.","43572",2019

Restoration programs can involve removing isolated, non-native trees planted by farmers for fruit or wood. As such legacy trees can attract seed dispersers and create microclimates that help native seedlings to establish, removing them may actually slow forest recovery. Working on abandoned farmland in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we evaluated the effect of legacy trees on forest recovery by measuring the number, diversity, and biomass of native seedlings and saplings regenerating in plots centered on avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), and Eucalyptus legacy trees compared with adjacent plots without legacy trees. The assemblages of native, forest-dependent tree species in plots around avocado and mango trees were distinct from each other and from those around eucalyptus and all the near-legacy plots. In particular, avocado plots had higher stem density and species richness of forest-dependent species than near-avocado plots, particularly large-seeded, shade-tolerant, and animal-dispersed species-key targets of many restoration plans. Furthermore, many of the species found in high numbers were among those failing to establish in ongoing large-scale forest restoration in Kibale. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the legacy trees facilitate the dispersal and establishment of native tree species. Retaining the existing legacy trees for a number of years could usefully complement existing management strategies to restore more biodiverse native forest in degraded lands. However, careful monitoring is needed to ensure that the legacy trees do not themselves establish.","MAR",2017

Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.","JUN",2008

They are mainly semi-natural patches that represent the last remnants of nature in metropolitan areas. As part of the agricultural and green infrastructure they provide ecosystem services, such as purification of air and water, mitigation of floods and droughts, re-generation of soil fertility, moderation of temperature extremes and enhancing of landscape quality. Like all natural ecosystems. NUAs today are endangered by urban sprawl, which is the main cause of their fragmentation and loss of evapotranspiration features. For these reasons, the protection of these areas is a fundamental issue for land-use planning, and it requires appropriate strategies for their management. We propose a land-use suitability strategy, based on five different analytical phases, to address the land-use of NUAs: (1) land-use and land cover analysis quantifies the percentage of evapotranspiring surface for each land-use; (2) fragmentation analysis assesses the size and density of NUAs: (3) proximity analysis takes into account the degree to which NUAs are close to residential areas; (4) the results from these analyses are integrated in a land-use suitability matrix, which produces as output a new scenario of prospective land-uses for NUAs; (5) a compatibility matrix verifies the correspondence of these new land-uses with the current ones to confirm or modify the proposed land-uses. The resulting scenario allows to enhance the production of ecosystem services and define new appropriate land-uses for NUAs within the agricultural and green infrastructure.

Land-use planners and managers are often responsible for providing access to natural areas for recreation while avoiding environmental impacts such as declines of threatened species. Since recreation can have harmful effects on biodiversity, reliable information about protected-area visitation patterns is vital for managers. Our goal was to quantify recreational use in a fragmented urban reserve network and identify factors that influenced visitation. We empirically measured visitation rates at 18 reserves in San Diego County, California. Using random forest models, we identified biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influenced spatial variation in visitation rates and made projections to 27 additional reserves, validating with an expert opinion survey. Visitation rates varied widely across the reserve network. Accessibility variables, such as numbers of housing units and parking lots, were key explanatory variables that had positive relationships with visitation rates. To illustrate the applications of our models, we assessed the exposure of 7 species and subspecies of conservation concern to recreation by comparing predicted occurrence to projected visitation intensities. We found that several species and subspecies, including the orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), western spadefoot (Spea hcunmondii), and the federally-threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), are likely exposed to high levels of recreational activity. Our results can be used to identify species for further research, highlight areas with potential conflict between recreation and conservation objectives, and forecast future changes in visitation.","JUL",2018

Here we present a novel evaluation framework of ecosystem services (ES) and pose different response models to landscape complexity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that complementarities among different ES types increase and the strength of their apparent tradeoffs diminishes with the spatial complexity of the rural landscapes, using a one million has basin of the Argentine pampas as study case. According to correlation and principal component analysis, main ES tradeoffs among ES availability observed at two spatial scales were represented by crop production vs. the other evaluated ES types (OES), and in contrast with our prediction, their strength was not higher for the fine- than for the coarse-scale (relatively large and internally complex observation units). Landscape composition and configuration indices showed a complementary capacity to explain spatial variation in OES, but combinations of configuration indices showed a higher explanatory value than composition ones. Widely accepted tradeoffs among ecosystem services at local levels, not only were able to explain their antagonistic but also their synergistic availability at intermediate levels of conversion of managed grasslands to croplands, depending on the evaluation scale. Despite intermediate complexity hypothesis was only partly supported by our results, these offer novel evidences about emergent responses in the form of nonlinearities and thresholds of total ES in relation to landscape complexity, which deserve further attention because of their relevance for land use planning.

The Pampean plain (Argentina) holds one of the main wetlands of South America, constituted by thousands of shallow lakes which provide valuable ecosystem services, and can be found in any of three regimes: clear-vegetated, inorganic-turbid or phytoplankton-turbid. Since these lakes play an important role in the global carbon balance, metabolism studies encompassing phytoplankton and periphyton under different regimes become relevant. Here, we analyzed the primary production (PP) of phytoplankton and periphyton in three Pampean shallow lakes representing the main types mentioned. The relative contribution of each algal community to the joint PP was different in each lake and related to their regime. The periphyton contribution was higher in the clear-vegetated lake than in the turbid lakes. The phytoplankton-turbid lake exhibited the highest PP for both communities. The inorganic-turbid lake presented the highest light limitation; nonetheless, the efficiency of periphyton in this lake showed an increasing trend with depth, suggesting light acclimation. Although phytoplankton dominated the PP in the three lakes, periphyton contribution was also important, particularly in the clear-vegetated lake. Our results emphasize that the PP of attached communities should be considered to estimate the PP of the whole lake.","FEB",2017

Agricultural landscapes provide the essential ecosystem service of food to growing human populations; at the same time, agricultural expansion to increase crop production results in forest fragmentation, degrading many other forest-dependent ecosystem services. However, surprisingly little is known about the role that forest fragments play in the provision of ecosystem services and how fragmentation affects landscape multifunctionality at scales relevant to land management decisions. 2. We measured the provision of six ecosystem services (crop production, pest regulation, decomposition, carbon storage, soil fertility and water quality regulation) in soya bean fields at different distances from adjacent forest fragments that differed in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada. 3. We observed significant effects of distance-from-forest, fragment isolation and fragment size on crop production, insect pest regulation, and decomposition. 4. Distance-from-forest and fragment isolation had unique influences on service provision for each of the ecosystem services we measured. For example, pest regulation was maximized adjacent to forest fragments, while crop production was maximized at intermediate distances-from-forest. As a consequence, landscape multifunctionality depended on landscape heterogeneity: the range of field and forest fragment types present. 5. We also observed strong negative and positive relationships between ecosystem services that were more prevalent at greater distances-from-forest. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study is one of the first to empirically measure and model the effects of forest fragments on the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem services in an agro-ecosystem at the landscape and field scales relevant to landowners and managers. Our results demonstrate that forest fragments, irrespective of their size, can affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services in surrounding fields, but that this effect is mediated by fragment isolation across the landscape. Our results also suggest that managing habitat fragmentation and landscape structure will improve our ability to optimize ecosystem service provision and create multifunctional agricultural landscapes.","AUG",2014

In the Port of Veracruz, Mexico, harbour expansion completely destroyed the dune area. A 2-km-long 10- to 20-m-high artificial and unstable dune, parallel to the coastline, was left. To revegetate this dune, we used 3 artificially created plant communities in which the dominant species had contrasting growth forms: Opuntia stricta (Cactaceae), Panicum maximum (tall grass), and Paspalum spp. (short grass). We monitored the vegetation and species turnover during 5 y. Plant cover reached almost 100% after only 1 y. Sand stabilization occurred at a faster rate on those locations covered by both grass types, but diversity of growth habits was highest at the Opuntia treatments. From 29 to 37% of the original dune species returned. The rehabilitated community was dominated by generalist herbs and vines (80%). Remnant patches with native vegetation played an important role in species turnover and promoted colonization by thicket and tropical dry forest species. The created ecosystems provided the required ecosystem service (prevention of shifting sand) and were self sustaining (at least over the 5-y period this study lasted), but with low diversity. When human disturbance is devastating, revegetation or even created ecosystems may be the only solution. However, restoration with native species should be promoted whenever possible.",NA,2008

Consequently, soil productive capacity, production sustainability, and resource use efficiency have declined in this agro-ecosystem. Ecological engineering approach such as legume inclusion in cropping system offers several ecosystem services, and thus, may serve an important role in the restoration of soil health. Given that, a long-term (2003-2015) field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of four rice-based crop rotation treatments [rice-wheat, rice-chickpea, rice-wheat-mungbean, rice-wheat-rice-chickpea] each with three levels of nutrient management treatments [control, integrated nutrient management, chemical fertilizers] on soil aggregation, soil carbon pools, and carbon stabilization. Legume inclusive rotations increased water stable macro-aggregates (WSMA) over rice-wheat rotation in both surface (0-0.2 m) and subsurface (0.2-0.4 m) soil depths. In surface soil, WSMA was the highest in rice-wheat-mungbean rotation (65%) followed by rice-chickpea rotation (57%) and was the least in rice-wheat rotation (50%). Subsequently, grain legume inclusive rotations had the higher aggregate ratio and mean weight diameter over rice-wheat rotation, being the highest in rice-wheat-mungbean rotation. Rice-wheat-mungbean and rice-chickpea rotations had higher carbon concentration in coarse macro-aggregates, meso-aggregates, and coarse micro-aggregates as compared with rice-wheat rotation. Grain legume inclusive rotations increased active carbon pool (9-18%), SOC (6-17%), and carbon management index (5-7%) over rice-wheat rotation, and the order was rice-wheat-mungbean > rice-chickpea rice-wheat-rice-chickpea > rice-wheat. Integrated nutrient management treatment resulted in higher macro-aggregate (7%), mean weight diameter (6%), active carbon pool (22%), passive carbon pool (16%), SOC (20%), and carbon management index (22%) over the chemical fertilizer treatment. Thus, it is concluded that inclusion of grain legume in lowland rice-based rotation and integrated nutrient management could improve soil aggregation, carbon concentration in aggregates, and soil carbon pools in the tropical soils.

ES assessment helps to deal with the complexity of the interrelationships among LULC, ES supply and societal benefits. Using the case of the Phewa watershed, Nepal, this paper presents a quantitative and qualitative assessment of priority ES to understand how the supply of ES and their societal benefits have changed over the past 40 years. LULC changes were analysed using satellite images, ecosystem services were assessed using biophysical data and expressed spatially using ArcGIS. Results reveal a substantial reversal of land degradation and indicate forest recovery over the last 40 years. Dense forests increased by 1471 ha (88%) while sparse forests, grasslands and agricultural lands declined by 26%, 77% and 15%, respectively. These significant changes in LULC had a positive impact on ES due to the conversion of agricultural/grasslands and degraded forests to dense forests. ES varied significantly across the watershed. Dense forests provided relatively higher sediment retention (soil erosion rate decreased from > 30 ton ha(1) yr(1) to < 15 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)), carbon stocks (from < 50 m(3) ha(-1) to > 100 m(3) ha(-1)), habitat provision, and raw materials than other types of land cover, but reduced the water discharge. Increased aesthetic value from the restored landscape provides higher opportunities for recreation and ecotourism.

In the extensive regions where non-native species are firmly established, it is unlikely that historical conditions can be fully reinstated. To what degree, and how rapidly, can human-dominated areas be shifted via restoration into regimes that benefit target species, communities or processes? Location: We explore this question in a >20-year-old reforestation effort underway at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in montane Hawaii. This large-scale planting of Acacia koa trees is designed to secure populations of globally threatened bird species by transitioning the site rapidly from pasture to native forest. Methods: We surveyed all forest birds in multiple corridors of young planted trees, remnant corridors of mature trees along gulches and at sites within mature forest. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we identified which factors (distance from forest, habitat type and surrounding tree cover) had the most important influence on native and exotic bird abundance in the reforestation area. Results: We found that 90% of native and exotic bird species responded quickly, occupying corridors of native trees approximately a decade after planting. However, native and exotic forest birds responded to markedly different characteristics of the reforested area. Native bird abundance was strongly predicted by proximity to mature forest and remnant corridors; conversely, exotic bird abundance was best predicted by overall tree cover throughout the area reforested. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that large-scale tree planting in corridors adjacent to mature forest can catalyse rapid recovery (both increased abundance and expanded distribution) of forest birds and that it is possible to design reforestation to benefit native species in novel ecosystems.","JUN",2018

Early secondary successional trajectories are determined by a range of environmental factors that influence plant community development. Context-specific understanding of forest vegetation communities, their dynamics, and underlying drivers is needed for future restoration strategies. In this study we examined relationships between soil (chemical and physical) and environmental (landscape and topographical) characteristics, plant community attributes, and carbon stocks during early secondary succession. Data were collected at two sites undergoing early secondary succession in seasonally-dry Atlantic Forest (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). Both sites were previously used for pasture and abandoned at similar times, but showed differing vegetation communities. We found tree biomass and diversity and ecosystem carbon storage to be strongly positively related to the amount of surrounding forest, less steep slopes and clay soils, and negatively to the abundance of the shrub Leandra aurea. Soil carbon pools significantly increased with aboveground tree biomass. The only factor significantly affecting the metric of overall successional development (combining tree biomass and diversity) was total surrounding forest cover. Our findings suggest recovery of secondary forest and below-and aboveground carbon storage is limited by the amount of adjacent forest, some soil properties and dense shrub establishment down-regulating the succession process. Overall we offer evidence of potential to improve recovery of Atlantic forest with ecologically relevant seeding/planting programmes and selective shrub removal that could benefit ecosystem carbon storage.","SEP",2015

Such management threatens forest biodiversity and can reduce the provision of ecosystem services. Although the importance of ecosystem services is widely acknowledged, conservation strategies are hindered by poor knowledge about diversity patterns of service provider species as well as on mechanisms affecting these assemblages at different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we assessed the effect of disturbance management on forest pollinator communities. To do so, we used a large-scale ecological experiment conducted in the year 2000, where forest complexity was manipulated with different harvest regimes and prescribed fire. Results were consistent with a positive response of pollinators to increasing habitat heterogeneity driven by past disturbances. Harvested sites harbored a diverse pollinator community, and showed higher spatial and temporal turnover in species richness. Conversely, old-growth forest communities were a nested subset of harvested sites and contained half of their total diversity. Variation in community composition ( diversity) was primarily affected by species temporal turnover. Throughout the season, diversity was controlled by fire and harvesting legacies, which provide environmental heterogeneity in the form of flowering and nesting resources over space and time. Conservation strategies may undervalue ecosystem services in dynamic, naturally disturbance-driven, landscapes when relying solely on undisturbed forests areas. However, maintaining natural dynamics in early successional forests, by emulating natural disturbances at harvesting, hold promise for the conservation of both biodiversity and ecosystem services in boreal forests.",NA,2017

Specifically, it incorporates the role of natural capital in engineering assessment and design by quantifying both demand and supply of ecosystem services. Emergy can provide valuable support to improve and interpret TES evaluation, as it is a methodology particularly useful for evaluating systems at the biosphere-technosphere interface. The present study evaluates how the TES framework based on emergy can shed new light by comparing conventional technological alternatives and ecological alternatives for meeting a particular ecosystem service demand. Both the demand and supply of ecosystem services are quantified in consistent units of emergy to obtain aggregated TES metrics. Specifically it was found that additional equipment to treat air pollutants have a higher emergy investment as compared to the forest ecosystem, while the technological unit to treat wastewater requires less emergy as compared to the horizontal subsurface flow wetland, its ecological counterpart. This new approach is tested by application to a biodiesel production plant and by calculating emergy metrics. This work shows that emergy can provide a fundamental improvement to the current TES framework, as it provides an aggregated metric for multiple ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the provision of crucial ecosystem functions is not only determined by the extent, but also by the spatial configuration of forests within the landscape mosaic. An approach that aims to restore forest functions on a landscape scale is Forest Landscape Restoration, with the purpose to regain ecological integrity and support human well-being. The landscape-scale approach should enhance the contribution of site-based restoration to larger-scale processes and functional synergies. A fundamental challenge for Forest Landscape Restoration is therefore the identification of restoration areas within the landscape where multiple functions operating on different scales can be enhanced. Equally important is the task of identifying areas requiring restoration. Proposed strategies include the assessment of current, past, and reference landscape states. However, integrative planning approaches combining historical and functional perspectives on a landscape scale are little developed. In this paper, we demonstrate how forest restoration areas can be identified that account for historical forest patterns while simultaneously targeting multiple forest functions. We use a method developed for habitat suitability modeling based on recent historical forest occurrence and regeneration patterns from 1985 to 2008 in order to predict areas that are suitable for forest restoration (potential forest growth) as well as areas where forest potentially recovers by natural regeneration. For both, unsuitable areas are excluded by masking restoration constraints. Separately, we map potential forest functions and assess spatial synergies or ""multifunctional hotspots"" using spatial multi-criteria analysis. To derive a scenario of potential restoration areas, predicted maps of restoration suitability and regeneration potential are separately combined with a map depicting the degree of multifunctionality. These maps are finally overlapped to identify multifunctional restoration and regeneration areas. These designated areas are then evaluated regarding their distribution on current land cover and recent historical deforestation areas. We test this approach for the dry forest landscape in Central Chile, an international biodiversity hotspot, which has undergone profound historical transformations and considerable deforestation in recent decades.","JAN",2017

We present a framework built around the concept that migratory species act as carriers, delivering benefit flows to people throughout their annual cycle that are supported by the network of ecosystems upon which the species depend. We apply this framework to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration of eastern North America by calculating their spatial subsidies. Spatial subsidies are the net ecosystem service flows throughout a species' range and a quantitative measure of the spatial mismatch between the locations where people receive most benefits and the locations of habitats that most support the species. Results indicate cultural benefits provided by monarchs in the U.S. and Canada are subsidized by migration and overwintering habitat in Mexico. At a finer scale, throughout the monarch range, habitat in rural landscapes subsidizes urban residents. Understanding the spatial distribution of benefits derived from and ecological support provided to monarchs and other migratory species offers a promising means of understanding the costs and benefits associated with conservation across jurisdictional borders.

N.","URBAN ECOSYSTEMS","Urban forests have garnered increasing attention as providers of an array of beneficial ecosystem services. However, urban forest ecosystems are highly complex and heterogeneous systems whose structure are shaped by interacting social and ecological processes. Approaches to reliably identify and differentiate these processes could be valuable for addressing complexity and reducing uncertainty in decision-making in urban forestry. The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify a range of social and ecological drivers of urban forest species composition, distribution, and diversity. This was done using hierarchical cluster analysis and discriminant analysis with empirical plot data describing the tree species composition in Toronto, Canada. Tree density and imperviousness were by far the most influential drivers of species composition. Increasing imperviousness saw not just reduced tree density but a decline in native species abundance. Additionally, single-detached housing, homeownership, and income were closely associated and explained higher tree densities and abundances of native species. However, income had a lower than expected influence on urban forest species composition given its importance in canopy cover research. Continuous forest patches were highly distinct compared to the remainder of the urban landscape, which highlights the ecological distinctiveness of residual forests within cities and lends support to their conservation. Increasing the understanding of social and ecological drivers of tree species composition, distribution, and diversity within cities is an integral part of urban forest ecosystem classification, which can be a valuable decision-support tool for ecosystem-based management in urban forestry.","OCT",2018

However, not all floral visitors actually transfer pollen, and efforts to distinguish true pollinators from mere visitors are particularly scarce among the bat pollination literature. To determine whether Old World bat species are equally effective pollinators in mixed-agricultural areas of southern Thailand, we examined six night-blooming plant taxa and quantified pollinator importance (PI) of seven common nectarivorous bat species. PI was calculated as the product of nightly bat visitation rate (obtained from mist-netting data) and pollen transfer efficiency (estimated from bat pollen loads). We found that PI varied by both bat species and plant species. In general, the nectar-specialist bat species were more important pollinators, yet their order of importance differed across our focal plant species. In addition, PI was dictated more by pollen transfer effectiveness than visitation rate. Our findings highlight the importance of Old World bat pollinators within southern Thailand's mixed-agricultural landscape and illustrate how seemingly similar floral visitors can have very different contributions toward plant pollination success. ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????? 6 ????? ??????????????????????????? 7 ???? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

We hypothesized that large herbivores compound the effects of intensive forest management on early seral plant communities and plantation establishment (i.e., tree survival and growth), and the degree of such effects is dependent on the intensity of management practices. We established 225-m(2) wild-ungulate (deer and elk) exclosures, nested within a manipulated gradient of management intensity (no-herbicide control, light herbicide, moderate herbicide, and intensive herbicide treatments), replicated at the scale of whole harvest units (10-19 ha). Vegetation structure, composition, and crop-tree responses to herbivory varied across the gradient of herbicide application during the first two years of stand establishment, with herbivory effects most evident at light and moderate herbicide treatments. In the moderate herbicide treatment, which approximates management applied to >2.5 million hectares in the Pacific Northwest, United States, foraging by deer and elk resulted in simplified, low-cover plant communities more closely resembling the intensive herbicide treatment. Herbivory further suppressed the growth of competing vegetation in the light herbicide treatment, improving crop-tree survival, and providing early evidence of an ecosystem service. By changing community composition and vegetation structure, intensive forest management alters foraging selectivity and subsequent plant-herbivore interactions; initial shifts in early seral communities are likely to influence understory plant communities and tree growth in later stages of forest development.","DEC",2018

The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains poorly explored. 2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment-sown wildflower strips and hedgerows-and landscape-scale greening measures within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their contribution to crop yield. 3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average by 10% and 13%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures share was increased from 6% to 26%. For pollination, the increase was stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14%) than in fields without adjacent EFA (7%). 4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural management. 5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial, species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional production system studied. Further research is needed to better understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES. Potential improvements include minimising trade-offs while promoting synergies between ES provision, food production and biodiversity conservation.","MAR",2018

Understanding the efficacy and rationality of conservation practices on erosion mitigation is critical for contemporary strategy adjustment, which currently is hampered by the unavailability of historical observations on sediment yields at most ungauged catchments. Check dams were built with the primary purpose of sediment retention, while the infilling archives register historical sedimentary dynamics. A 485-cm long sediment core was extracted from a check dam in a restored agricultural catchment in the hilly Loess Plateau. Sedimentary stratigraphy was defined at 5-cm resolutions by continuous equivalent sectioning, and differentiated according to absolute grain-size composition and Cesium-137 (Cs-137) profile. Discernable stratigraphic laminations, featured by a fine-grained layer overlying on a coarse-grained layer, were observed, which were conducted by particle selectivity associated with soil detachment and sediment transport processes. Erosion and sediment dynamics across this semiarid landscape is strictly defined by extreme summer storms with large magnitude, low frequency and short duration. Sediment chronology was determined by ascribing the identified laminations to historical storm events. We found that the core profile showed evidence of at least 11 depositional events, which finally were connected with 11 major storms over the time period 1981-1983. We concluded that integrating stratigraphy differentiation of equivalent core segments along depositional profiles with storm records is diagnostic for inferring historical sedimentary dynamics.","43678",2018

With a focus on cultural ecosystem services and along different land use gradients a qualitative assessment of farmer's perceptions regarding cultural values of their landscapes was conducted. Interviews focused on traditional farming methods and the abundance of cultural values and perceptions that support the preservation of low-input, sustainable land management strategies. 73 indicators for Cultural Identity, Landscape Aesthetics, and Knowledge Systems were derived, revealing that socio-cultural structures and the socioeconomic situation of farmers influence their view on landscape-related cultural services.

We identified 13 functional groups within the planktonic and littoral communities, each one representing a biotic indicator and a node in a simplified food web network. The abiotic environment and most functional groups differed significantly as a consequence of the glacial influence. In general, runoff from glacial meltwaters resulted in highly simplified food webs. Considering that many turbid glacially fed lakes are losing their hydrological connection with disappearing/retreating glaciers and shifting to a clear state, our results suggest that this shift could enhance food web complexity, but at the cost of losing specific habitats. Further, retreat of large glaciers will form new glacially fed lakes, but it remains unclear whether this will buffer the expected habitat and biodiversity loss.",NA,NA

First, based on a scientific review, this paper analyses how efficiently CWs can remove nitrate and pesticides from the runoff in drained agricultural watersheds. Average efficiency ranges from 20 to 90% and from 40 to 90% for pesticides and nitrate respectively. The main processes involved are based on microbiological activities, for which hydraulic residence time is a key factor. In order to successful implementation of such a wetland system, hydrological diagnosis of water flow and pollutant transfer at different watershed scales should be provided. Typically, the transport and transformation of pollutants shows clear seasonality depending on the application of nitrate (throughout the whole year) and pesticides (only after application periods). We suggest two interception strategies based on field experiments. The on-stream strategy means the establishment of free water surface (FWS) CWs directly on streams/ditches and the interception of all drainage flows: a solution suitable for nitrate removal. The off-stream strategy requires the establishment of CWs outside of streams/ditches, whereas interception targets only the most polluted water flow, for instance during the period after pesticide application, requiring farmer's involvement. Suggestions are also made for FWS CW design (a geotechnical survey, topography constraints, etc.) respecting ecological engineering concepts. A following size range is proposed: 76m(3) per drained hectare, equivalent to 1% of the upstream area, given a maximum water depth of 0.8m. Nevertheless, CWs must be considered as a complementary tool dedicated to transfer reduction, and as part of broader actions aimed at reducing pollutant loading at the plot scale.

These organisms can disperse between non-crop habitats and crops and can benefit from resources in non-crop areas. Thus, it may be important to conserve non-crop habitats to maintain ecosystem services within crops. However, even single ecosystem services, such as pollination or predation of pests, may be provided by a complex of species. Different species may respond to landscape structure at differing spatial scales. This raises the question: What scales should conservation take place at to sustain an ecosystem service? Here, we examine variation in predation of two potato pests in response to landscape structure. Specifically, predation of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were quantified in potato and field-margin habitats set in landscapes that varied at different scales. At a local scale (meters), potato fields of different sizes were bordered by different areas of grassy field margin. At a broad scale (kilometers), these habitats were set in landscapes composed of varying percentages of non-crop habitat. Predation of both pests was associated with landscape structure, but this relationship occurred at different scales for each pest and interacted differently with habitat type. Predation of L. decemlineata eggs was greater in field margins than in the potato crop and increased in both habitats when field margins were large relative to potatoes. In contrast, aphid predation in field margins increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km, but did not change in adjacent potato. These data emphasize that, even a single ecosystem service, such as predation of pests, can be influenced by landscape structure at multiple scales. More generally, it may be necessary to conserve heterogeneity both at local scales (individual farm fields) and broad scales (entire mosaic landscapes) to maintain ecosystem services. This may be especially true for ecosystem services that are the aggregate result of the actions of many species or ecological processes.","JUN",2010

However, assessments of landscape potential for tourism tend to be very general. Therefore, this study proposes a method that takes into account both the complexity of landscape and the behavior of tourists. We introduce a new approach that encompasses both human and ecological aspects. The latter is broken down into biotic and abiotic elements, characterized by a variety of features. Tourism is assessed as a set of outdoor activities that are analyzed individually. Natural landscape potential is divided into intrinsic and service potential. Intrinsic potential describes the capacity of the landscape to be used for tourism purposes. Service potential adds tourists' willingness to undertake an activity. This is an important extension, as landscape service potential should be assessed as a function of the use tourists make of it; whether very often (e.g. walking) or very rarely (e.g. windsurfing). The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to evaluate landscape properties, and a questionnaire evaluated tourist behavior. A case study was carried out in the Great Masurian Lakes (northeast Poland), which revealed substantial differences in the spatial diversity of intrinsic and service potentials. Furthermore, it showed that there are neither universally positive, nor negative landscape features as different activities have different, and sometimes opposing requirements. We believe that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of landscape potential assessment for tourism, thereby improving landscape planning and management.","FEB",2018

Taking the Zhifanggou watershed as an example, this study built an energy flow model for the watershed considering croplands, woodlands and grasslands as components. This study evaluated the changes in ecosystem service values before and after the implementation of a Grain for Green (GFG) program using the method of equivalent value factor per-unit of ecosystem area. Then changes in ecosystem service values in the Zhifanggou watershed were simulated. The results were as follows: (1) the total value of ecosystem services showed a linear increase (P < 0.01) from 1995 to 2010, increase 44.2% over this time. In addition, the provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural service values showed a cooperative growth trend (P < 0.01). (2) The change in ecosystem service values in the watershed was very small over the period examined and if the GFG program continues, it will stabilize after a slight net increase. Provisioning services showed a downward trend, while regulating, supporting and cultural services show an upward trend, furthermore, provisioning services showed a trade-off relationship with the other three services (P < 0.01).

We apply this approach to further existing conceptual models of river assessment by identifying how benthic indicators can be linked to valued ecosystem services in a river services assessment framework. This approach extends bioassessment from a focus on assessing departure from reference condition to also include the evaluation of rivers based on their delivery of ecosystem services. Indicators based on benthic processes and assemblages are widely used in river health assessments; thus, these are reviewed to identify those indicators most closely linked with the provision of river ecosystem services. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can be applied to management through contrasting watershed examples, including a highly modified agricultural region and relatively pristine Arctic watersheds. The proposed approach supports an explicit connection between valued ecosystem services and benthic indicators, providing more targeted assessment results for use in river management decision-making.","MAR",2019

Although most U. S. production of ethanol is from corn, it is envisaged that future ethanol production will also draw from cellulosic sources such as perennial grasses. In selecting optimal bioenergy crops, there is debate as to whether it is preferable from an environmental standpoint to cultivate bioenergy crops with high ecosystem services (a ""land-sharing"" strategy) or to grow crops with lower ecosystem services but higher yield, thereby requiring less land to meet bioenergy demand (a ""land-sparing"" strategy). Here, we develop a simple model to address this question. Assuming that bioenergy crops are competing with uncultivated land, our model calculates land requirements to meet a given bioenergy demand intensity based upon the yields of bioenergy crops. The model combines fractional land cover of each ecosystem type with its associated ecosystem services to determine whether land-sharing or land-sparing strategies maximize ecosystem services at the landscape level. We apply this model to a case in which climate protection through GHG regulation-an ecosystem's greenhouse gas value (GHGV)-is the ecosystem service of interest. Our results show that the relative advantages of land sparing and land sharing depend upon the type of ecosystem displaced by the bioenergy crop; as the GHGV of the unfarmed land increases, the preferable strategy shifts from land sharing to land sparing. Although it may be preferable to replace ecologically degraded land with high-GHGV, lower yielding bioenergy crops, average landscape GHGV will most often be maximized through high-yielding bioenergy crops that leave more land for uncultivated, high-GHGV ecosystems. Although our case study focuses on GHGV, the same principles will be applicable to any ecosystem service whose value does not depend upon the spatial configuration of the landscape. Whenever bioenergy crops have substantially lower ecosystem services than the ecosystems with which they are competing for land, the most effective strategy for meeting bioenergy demand while maximizing ecosystem services on a landscape level is one of land sparing: focusing simultaneously on maximizing the yield of bioenergy crops while preserving or restoring natural ecosystems.","DEC",2012

Low-intensive agricultural landscapes are of utmost importance for biodiversity conservation and the delivery of cultural ecosystem services. We worked in a cultural landscape shaped by viticulture (in Trentino, Italy), which recently underwent a widespread intensification. We explicitly quantified two cultural services (aesthetic and cultural heritage values), and the biodiversity (bird species richness) associated with this landscape at 24 sampling sites. We then related these variables with the territory density of an indicator/flagship bird species, the common redstart. Finally, we assessed redstart ecological requirements at the territory scale. We aimed to define an appealing strategy combining biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery in the cultural landscapes. Redstart density was positively related with avian species richness and landscape aesthetic value, the latter being related with the cultural heritage value. Redstart occurrence was positively associated with hedge and tree rows, dry-stone walls, marginal habitats, and the compositional diversity of the land-cover. We concluded that managing the agricultural landscape to maintain aesthetic and heritage values, which primarily means conserving and enhancing its key 'traditional' traits, would favour an indicator/flagship species and likely the wider bird diversity. It will also promote the heritage and recreational value of the landscape itself, underlining the importance of the synergistic integration of multiple conservation targets into a combined strategy.","43539",2018

Butterflies were more abundant and diverse in plantations than in the forest, whereas this pattern was opposite for resident butterflies and termites. There was marked faunal turnover between plantations and forest. We conclude that (a) the magnitude of faunal changes between forest and plantations is less drastic for termites than for butterflies; (b) resident butterfly species are more impacted by the conversion of forest to plantations than all butterflies, including transient species; and (c) species richness does not necessarily decrease in the series forest > native > exotic plantations. Whereas there are advantages of studying more tractable taxa such as butterflies, the responses of such taxa can be highly unrepresentative of other invertebrate groups responsible for different ecological services.","JAN",2017

Soil microbial communities may have a role in explaining this variation due to both site-to-site variation in the composition of soil microbial communities and due to variation that can arise due to plant-soil feedbacks. We tested the relative importance of between-site variation in soil microbial community composition and plant-soil feedbacks in shaping plant community composition and ecosystem function. We used a standard two-phase plant-soil feedback design. Soil inoculum was collected from four tallgrass prairie sites. Then, soils were conditioned separately with nine plant species, and conditioned soils were used to inoculate prairie community mesocosms. In a separate experiment using soil from an additional site we tested conditioned soil samples for the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobia. Site of soil origin and plant-soil feedbacks both had effects on the composition and productivity of our plant communities, and the magnitudes of these effects were similar. We also found changes in the abundance of AMF and rhizobia due to plant-soil feedbacks and that AMF abundance were associated with differences in plant community composition. These results indicate that the composition of soil communities due to site-to-site variation and plant-soil feedbacks are both important determinants of plant community composition and productivity. Our results also suggest that AMF and rhizobia are key microbial functional groups underlying plant-soil feedback effects. Synthesis and applications. Site-to-site variation in soil communities can explain some variation in restoration of plant communities. Since plant-soil feedback effects of restored plant species do not overcome this variation, knowledge of soil microbial communities present at a site prior to initiation of restoration efforts may improve predictability of restoration outcomes, and reintroduction of some components of the soil community may be necessary to achieve restoration goals. Additionally, by understanding variation due to plant-soil feedbacks, restoration practitioners can choose plant species for reintroduction that will create favourable soil conditions, including promoting microbial mutualists. Plant-soil feedbacks should also make it possible to increase heterogeneity in soil microbial communities, leading to increases in beta diversity in plant communities.

Scientists generally rely on biological indicators of these stressors to signal that ecosystem conditions have been altered. However, these biological indicators are not always capable of being directly related to ecosystem components that provide benefits to humans and/or can be used to evaluate the cost-benefit of a change in health of the component (ecosystem services). Therefore, we developed the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to link changes in a biological indicator of a stressor to final ecosystem services. The STEPS Framework produces ""chains"" of ecological components that explore the breadth of impacts resulting from the change in a stressor. Chains are comprised of the biological indicator, the ecological production function (EPF, which uses ecological components to link the biological indicator to a final ecosystem service), and the user group who directly uses, appreciates, or values the component. The framework uses a qualitative score (high, medium, low) to describe the strength of science (SOS) for the relationship between each component in the EPF. We tested the STEPS Framework within a workshop setting using the exceedance of critical loads of air pollution as a model stressor and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) to describe final ecosystem services. We identified chains for four modes of ecological response to deposition: aquatic acidification, aquatic eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and terrestrial eutrophication. The workshop participants identified 183 unique EPFs linking a change in a biological indicator to a FEGS; when accounting for the multiple beneficiaries, we ended with 1104 chains. The SOS scores were effective in identifying chains with the highest confidence ranking as well as those where more research is needed. The STEPS Framework could be adapted to any system in which a stressor is modifying a biological component. The results of the analysis can be used by the social science community to apply valuation measures to multiple or selected chains, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of anthropogenic stressors on measures of human well-being.","MAY",2017

Alternative products are promoted as environmentally sustainable, but effects on dung fauna and dung processing have not yet been investigated. We assessed the effects of one conventional product (ivermectin) and three alternatives (a homoeopathic product, Bug A Tub (a free-choice lick containing <5% diatomaceous earth, plant oils and nutritional supplements) and a copper bolus), on dung fauna and decomposition. Bug A Tub reduced the attractiveness of dung, the abundance of dung-associated insects in the soil beneath pats, emergent insect biomass and dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) emergence. Ivermectin dramatically altered insect assemblages, reducing emergent fly biomass. lvermectin also reduced emergent dung beetle abundance. Dung from ivermectin-treated cattle had a significantly lower rate of decomposition, similar to when invertebrates were excluded, but none of the alternative products affected decomposition. Insect emergence varied widely for dung collected from cattle grazing different fields, highlighting the need to ensure experimental products are not confounded with dung source. Dung from ivermectin-treated cattle can act as an ecological trap (a poor-quality environment which associated invertebrates are forced to colonise) with potentially major consequences for the ecosystem service of dung decomposition. Bug A Tub can affect insects colonising dung, highlighting a need for tests on the environmental safety of alternative products; such testing is not currently a legal requirement.

S.","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","Mixed tree plantings and natural regeneration are the main restoration approaches for recovering tropical forests worldwide. Despite substantial differences in implementation costs between these methods, little is known regarding how they differ in terms of ecological outcomes, which is key information for guiding decision making and cost-effective restoration planning. Here, we compared the early ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in agricultural landscapes. We assessed and compared vegetation structure and composition in young (7-20yr old) mixed tree plantings (PL), second-growth tropical forests established on former pastures (SGp), on former Eucalyptus spp. plantations (SGe), and in old-growth reference forests (Ref). We sampled trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) 1-5cm (saplings) and trees at DBH > 5cm (trees) in a total of 32 20x45m plots established in these landscapes. Overall, the ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and restoration plantations were markedly different. SGe forests showed higher abundance of large (DBH>20cm) nonnative species, of which 98% were resprouting Eucalyptus trees, than SGp and PL, and higher total aboveground biomass; however, aboveground biomass of native species was higher in PL than in SGe. PL forests had lower abundance of native saplings and lianas than both naturally established second-growth forests, and lower proportion of animal dispersed saplings than SGe, probably due to higher isolation from native forest remnants. Rarefied species richness of trees was lower in SGp, intermediate in SGe and Ref and higher in PL, whereas rarefied species richness of saplings was higher in SG than in Ref. Species composition differed considerably among regeneration types. Although these forests are inevitably bound to specific landscape contexts and may present varying outcomes as they develop through longer time frames, the ecological particularities of forests established through different restoration approaches indicate that naturally established forests may not show similar outcomes to mixed tree plantings. The results of this study underscore the importance that restoration decisions need to be based on more robust expectations of outcomes that allow for a better analysis of the cost-effectiveness of different restoration approaches before scaling-up forest restoration in the tropics.","MAR",2018

Although exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to the mangrove wetlands (including the associated unvegetated shoals) of China, its effects on the macrobenthic fauna in such wetlands is poorly understood. The macrobenthic faunal communities were compared in (1) an Avicennia marina monoculture vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded A. marina stand (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and in (2) an unvegetated shoal vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded shoal that had rapidly become an S. alterniflora monoculture in Zhanjiang, China. S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased plant density regardless of invaded habitat but significantly increased the contents of total carbon, organic matter, and total sulfur in the sediment only in the unvegetated shoal. The presence of S. alterniflora had little influence on indices of the macrobenthic faunal community in the A. marina monoculture, but significantly decreased the density and biomass of macrobenthic faunal community in the unvegetated shoal. These results indicate that the effects of S. alterniflora on the macrobenthic faunal community depend on which type of mangrove habitat is invaded. The composition of the macrobenthic faunal community was more similar between the invaded and non-invaded A. marina stand than between the invaded and non-invaded unvegetated shoal.

Recently, there has been a shift from examining the role of species richness in isolation towards understanding how species interact to effect ecosystem function. Here, we briefly review theoretical predictions regarding species contributions to functional diversity and redundancy and further use simulated data to test combined effects of species richness, number of functional traits, and species differences within these traits on unique species contributions to functional diversity and redundancy, as well as on the overall functional diversity and redundancy within species assemblages. Our results highlighted that species richness and species functional attributes interact in their effects on functional diversity. Moreover, our simulations suggested that functional differences among species have limited effects on the proportion of redundancy of species contributions as well as on the overall redundancy within species assemblages, but that redundancy rather was determined by number of traits and species richness. Our simulations finally indicated scale dependence in the relative effects of species richness and functional attributes, which suggest that the relative influence of these factors may affect individual contributions differently compared to the overall ecosystem function of species assemblages. We suggest that studies on the relationship between biological diversity and ecosystem function will benefit from focusing on multiple processes and ecological interactions, and that the relative functional attributes of species will have pivotal roles for the ecosystem function of a given species assembly.","FEB",2012

There is abundant local-scale evidence that both pollinator diversity and pollination services decrease with increasing agricultural intensification. This raises concerns regarding food security, as two-thirds of the world's major food crops are pollinator-dependent. Whether such local findings scale up and affect crop production over larger scales is still being debated. Here, we analyzed a country-wide dataset of the 54 major crops in France produced over the past two decades and found that benefits of agricultural intensification decrease with increasing pollinator dependence, to the extent that intensification failed to increase the yield of pollinator-dependent crops and decreased the stability of their yield over time. This indicates that benefits from agricultural intensification may be offset by reductions in pollination services, and supports the need for an ecological intensification of agriculture through optimization of ecosystem services.","MAY",2014

In theory, ecosystem management will utilize the best available science to sustain social-ecological systems in the landscape by maximizing multiple ecosystem services expected from the stake-holders' of those systems. Llancahue is a watershed (1,270 ha) that provides fresh water to the city of Valdivia (130,000 inhabitants) and protects[ 700 ha of old-growth forest within a severely disturbed landscape in the lowlands of south-central Chile. The native vegetation of this landscape is the threatened Valdivian Temperate Rainforests. Management of the watershed by the Universidad Austral de Chile needs to both provide timber and work to the neighboring campesinos (small poor rural land owners) who were illegally logging the forest and improve the conservation of the old-growth forests and the quantity and quality of water provided by the watershed. This paper demonstrates how adaptive management has utilized a multi-step process to improve management of the watershed. This process has included (1) understanding stakeholders' views towards the project, (2) developing an ecosystem management plan for the watershed that balanced multiple societal demands and ecosystem functions from the watershed, and (3) monitoring the Llancahue forest and streams to ensure activities provided desired results. This paper reports results after 4 years of implementation and provides perspectives on the ecosystem management approach.","FEB",2014

However, there is still debate on whether currently available incentives are efficiently enhancing farmland biodiversity. Moreover, agri-environment schemes often lead to a yield reduction, which has been argued to potentially increase pressure on non-cropped habitats, with unintended negative environmental consequences. Here, we argue that AES should build on more explicit goals regarding (1) biodiversity protection as such and (2) provisioning of ecosystem services benefiting agricultural production. We discuss how this can be achieved by an efficient spatial allocation of AES measures to the benefit of biodiversity, ecosystem service providers and agricultural production. We differentiate between biodiversity conservation schemes, which target species of conservation concern, and ecosystem service schemes which explicitly target ecosystem service providers important for environmentally sustainable agriculture, most of which are common species. We construct a simplistic, conceptual model, based on well-founded ecological principles, to illustrate how to allocate biodiversity conservation schemes and ecosystem service schemes spatially, depending on where they are needed in order to meet the goals of protecting biodiversity per se and promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture. By understanding the functional importance of different types of AES we can achieve much more effective schemes in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","APR",2014

Here we sought evidence of sustainable intensification among British farmers by selecting innovative arable, dairy, mixed and upland farms and analysing their own data on yields, inputs and land use and management for 2006 and 2011. The evidence was obtained by interview, and was interpreted in terms of the ecosystem services of food production (GJ ha(-1), where area took into account estimated area to grow any imported animal feeds), regulation of climate, air and water quality (modelled emissions of GHGs (CO(2)e ha(-1)), ammonia (kg ha(-1)) and nitrate loss (kg ha(-1))) and biodiversity (using an index based on the presence of habitats and management). Several farms have increased both food production and other ecosystem services over this time by increasing yields, using resources more efficiently and/or enhancing biodiversity, and sometimes by reducing livestock numbers and increasing cropping. The motivation has been to improve farm profitability through increasing food production, reducing input costs and accessing public payments through agri-environment schemes and generating renewable energy. Such sustainable intensification was not achieved by farmers who increased meat or milk yields. Sustainable intensification can be achieved when the correct drivers are in place to influence the actions of individual farmers. Also, it is possible to indicate sustainable intensification by using a small number of high-level indicators derived from data that farmers already hold, though such an approach may not capture the impacts of farmer innovative practices.

We analysed how the reduction of water erosion as a regulating service impacts six other ecosystem services. Ecological integrity, provisioning services (provision of food and fibre, provision of biomass), regulating services (soil erosion protection, drought-risk regulation, flood regulation), and the cultural service landscape aesthetics are taken into account. Using a decision support software, we found that the greening of preferential discharge paths can reduce water erosion by 2-7 %. The introduction of hedgerows and the change in the soil management system from tillage to no-till practices revealed a reduction in the total soil loss by 33 and 89 %, respectively. A combination of the three erosion control measures-greening, hedgerows, and no-till management-reduced the soil loss most efficiently by 92 %. We found synergies between the measures for reducing erosion and the provision of ecological integrity, of regulating and cultural ecosystem services. In contrast, the impact on provisioning services was slightly negative. For the land use planning in the case study region we recommend therefore a combination of greening, hedges, and management change. We found that the applied integrated ecosystem services assessment approach, in combination with stakeholder involvement in the scenario development, helped communicating cross-sectoral effects of different management strategies in a comprehensive way and therefore supports regional planning.","OCT",2014

Investigating combined effects of warming and toxicants has been a topic of little research, but neglecting their combined effects may seriously misguide management efforts. To explore how toxic chemicals and warming, alone and in combination, propagate across levels of biological organization, including a key ecosystem process, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) of a freshwater amphipod detritivore, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, feeding on leaf litter. In this IBM, life history emerges from the individuals' energy budgets. We quantified, in different warming scenarios (+1-+4 degrees C), the effects of hypothetical toxicants on suborganismal processes, including feeding, somatic and maturity maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Warming reduced mean adult body sizes and population abundance and biomass, but only in the warmest scenarios. Leaf litter processing, a key contributor to ecosystem functioning and service delivery in streams, was consistently enhanced by warming, through strengthened interaction between the detritivorous consumer and its resource. Toxicant effects on feeding and maintenance resulted in initially small adverse effects on consumers, but ultimately led to population extinction and loss of ecosystem process. Warming in combination with toxicants had little effect at the individual and population levels, but ecosystem process was impaired in the warmer scenarios. Our results suggest that exposure to the same amount of toxicants can disproportionately compromise ecosystem processing depending on global warming scenarios; for example, reducing organismal feeding rates by 50% will reduce resource processing by 50% in current temperature conditions, but by up to 200% with warming of 4 degrees C. Our study has implications for assessing and monitoring impacts of chemicals on ecosystems facing global warming.

Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable. In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others.","43539",2018

The dry weight of soil bioturbated during the dry season ranged between 216 and 32 tons ha(-1) mon(-1) in the most rehabilitated Zai forest and the barren area, respectively. By creating tunnels, the foraging activity of termites increased the water infiltration rate by a factor of 2 to 4. Sheetings built on compost and hay showed significant increase in most parameters relevant for plant growth, especially during the dry season. However, the benefits resulting from the termites' tunnelling activities (improved water availability and soil aeration via macropores, soil turnover) are in the early stages of Zai restoration likely to be more essential than the increased nutrient contents in sheeting soil, since water deficit leads to sapling mortality much faster than nutrient shortage. Our study revealed that the impact of termites is dependent on the particular species and their ecological requirements. Further studies in other areas are urgently required to clarify how generally valid our results are. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","43467",2017

Although progress has been made in setting targets, the diverse linkages among ecological and social components make target setting for coupled social-ecological systems extremely challenging. Developing integrated social-ecological targets is difficult because it forces policy makers to consider how management actions propagate throughout social-ecological systems, and because ultimately it is society, not scientists, that defines targets. We developed an interdisciplinary approach for identifying management targets and illustrate this approach using an example motivated by Puget Sound, USA. Our approach blends ecological modeling with empirical social science to articulate trade-offs and reveal societal preferences for different social-ecological states. The framework aims to place information in the hands of decision makers and promote discussion in the appropriate forums. Our ultimate objective is to encourage the informed participation of citizens in the development of social-ecological targets that reflect their values while also protecting key ecosystem attributes.",NA,2015

M.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient relative to productivity, provisioning services, such as crop production, can often be increased without losing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses dense, mixed, and seasonal forests and has high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. We examined trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF to provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on tree species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness, and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the 3 forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity by improving local management practices. The 3 forest types had similar patterns in ES trade-offs, although within mixed forest patterns differed. Biodiversity appeared to be more sensitive to land-use change than crop revenues. Certain crops yielded up to 10 times higher values in some sites. Enhanced crop productivity may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our results showed that to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF, maximizing crop productivity is needed . Increasing efficiency of management outcomes by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on knowledge of forest type, the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and preserving species in a balanced manner across forests. Compensaciones de Uso de Suelo entre la Biodiversidad de arboles y la Produccion Agricola en el Bosque Atlantico Las compensaciones en los servicios ecosistemicos (SE) han recibido mayor atencion porque los servicios de aprovisionamiento a menudo conllevan la perdida de biodiversidad. Cuando los patrones de uso de suelo no son maximamente eficientes en relacion con la productividad, los servicios de aprovisionamiento, como la produccion agricola, a menudo pueden ser incrementados sin perder biodiversidad. El Bosque Atlantico (BA) comprende bosques densos, mixtos y estacionales y tiene altos niveles de endemismo y amenazas antropogenicas. Examinamos las compensaciones entre biodiversidad y produccion agricola en el BA para proporcionar ideas para las decisiones de manejo de uso de suelo. Desarrollamos una medida de la biodiversidad que combina informacion sobre la riqueza de arboles, la singularidad evolutiva y rareza a nivel local Examinamos el grado en que la naturaleza de las compensaciones de los SE difiere entre los 3 tipos de bosque. Evaluamos como afectan las tasas anuales de deforestacion y las practicas de manejo a la biodiversidad y a las ganancias agricolas. Finalmente, probamos si es posible obtener la misma ganancia regional total son reducir la biodiversidad mediante la mejora de las practicas de manejo locales. Los 3 tipos de bosque tuvieron patrones similares de compensaciones de SE, aunque los patrones difirieron en los bosques mixtos. La biodiversidad parecio ser mas sensible al cambio de uso de suelo que a las ganancias agricolas. Ciertos cultivos proporcionaron valores 10 veces mas altos en algunos sitios. El incremento de la produccion agricola puede incrementar las ganancias sin reducir la biodiversidad. Nuestros resultados muestran que para incrementar el bienestar humano sin mayor alteracion del BA se requiere maximizar la produccion agricola. El incremento de la eficiencia del manejo al mantener mas biodiversidad y aumentar los servicios de aprovisionamiento depende del conocimiento del tipo de bosque, de la ventaja comparativa de sembrar cultivos en los mejores sitios y la preservacion de especies de manera equilibrada en los bosques.

Davis; Perfecto, Ivette; Vandermeer, John","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Our knowledge of ecological interactions that bolster ecosystem function and productivity has broad applications to the management of agricultural systems. Studies suggest that the presence of generalist predators in agricultural landscapes leads to a decrease in the abundance of herbivorous pests, but our understanding of how these interactions vary across taxa and along gradients of management intensity and eco-geographic space remains incomplete. In this study, we assessed the functional response and biocontrol potential of a highly ubiquitous insectivore (lizards in the genus Anolis) on the world's most important coffee pest, the coffee berry borer (Hypothalemus hampei). We conducted field surveys and laboratory experiments to examine the impact of land-use intensification on species richness and abundance of anoles and the capacity of anoles to reduce berry borer infestations in mainland and island coffee systems. Our results show that anoles significantly reduce coffee infestation rates in laboratory settings (Mexico, p = .03, F = 5.13 df = 1, 35; Puerto Rico, p = .014, F = 8.82, df = 1, 10) and are capable of consuming coffee berry borers in high abundance. Additionally, diversified agroecosystems bolster anole abundance, while high-intensity practices, including the reduction of vegetation complexity and the application of agrochemicals were associated with reduced anole abundance. The results of this study provide supporting evidence of the positive impact of generalist predators on the control of crop pests in agricultural landscapes, and the role of diversified agroecosystems in sustaining both functionally diverse communities and crop production in tropical agroecosystems.","APR",2017

Due to poor infrastructure and a limited capacity of PA managers, most of the PAs in developing countries fail to achieve their management targets. In this paper, the potential to integrate ecosystem services (ES) into land-use planning was assessed in order to better manage PAs in tropical countries. Firstly, we mapped the relative capacity of different land-use/land cover (LULC) to supply ES in and around the Satchari National Park (SNP) located in northeast Bangladesh. Two alternative scenarios to envisage the likely future supply of ES in the area were then analysed. The study reveals a relatively higher supply of supporting ES from LULC located inside the park compared to the ES supplied from surrounding forests, tea gardens, and oil palm and rubber plantations. Provisioning ES were greater in surrounding forests than from SNP. Both regulating and cultural ES were also higher in LULC within the park. Spatially explicit ES supply assessment and mapping was found to be useful for land use planning and the prioritization of future management actions. Based on our findings, we suggest that PA managers should consider the ES framework as an effective tool for the future-oriented PAs management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, using a multi-scale hierarchical design in southwestern France, we examined the effects of organic farming and seminatural habitats at the local and landscape scales on biological control services of three pests, including weeds and insects, in 42 vineyards. Organic farming at the local and landscape scales was beneficial to the mean and temporal stability of biological control services, while the proportion of seminatural habitats in the landscape reduced the level of biological pest control potential. The effects of organic farming and seminatural habitats across spatial scales varied with the type of prey considered and with time. Egg moth removal rates were higher in fields under organic management compared to conventional management while weed seed removal rates increased with the proportion of organic farming in the landscape. Larval removal rates as well as seed removal rates were always more stable within time in organic fields than in conventional fields. Moreover, independently of farming system type, local variables describing the agricultural management intensity, such as pesticide use or crop productivity, were also found to be important variables explaining levels of biological control services. Pesticide use tended to reduce biological control potential, while crop productivity was associated with contrasting biological control responses depending on the pest type. Our study demonstrates the need to target multiple spatial scales and to consider farming practices, as well as the proportion of seminatural habitats, to design functional landscapes that optimize biological pest control services.","JAN",2019

This study focused on changes in soil and vegetation properties following Acacia removal. The aim was to quantify the long-term consequences of alien clearing. Paired cleared (old 15 years; medium - 11 years; recent - 6 years) and uncleared sites were selected along the Palmiet catchment in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Various soil physico- chemical properties (soil moisture, pH, P, N, C, K, Na, Ca, Mg and soil repellency) and vegetation diversity measures were studied on 10 m 9 10 m plots. Results indicate that measured soil nutrients are significantly (P < 0.05) lower in cleared than in uncleared sites. However, comparisons among cleared sites alone indicate that soil properties are recovering with older cleared sites having higher (P < 0.05) nutrients than recent cleared sites. Soils in uncleared sites are more repellent than soil in cleared sites. Vegetation recovery in cleared sites was taking place with older cleared sites having higher native species diversity than recently cleared site. We conclude that the removal of alien plants could have caused a reduction in soil nutrients. However, as native vegetation recovers on cleared sites, soil nutrients are gradually improving.","DEC",2016

Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change. Collectively, our results indicate that future changes in SOM and plant productivity, regulated by cascading effects of precipitation on freshwater availability and salinity, could impact wetland stability and affect the supply of some wetland ecosystem services.","NOV",2018

The biodiversity and ecosystems protected by these areas deliver several ecosystem services. Recently, besides increasing global protected coverage, there has been a growing demand to assess the adequacy of protected areas management. In this study, we assessed how the management of protected areas can deal with ecosystem services taking as example the Don ana and Sierra Nevada protected areas (Spain). For that aim we analyzed the protected area management plans, mapped seven ecosystem services, and assessed how they are affected by protected area zoning and land-use intensity. We found that although provisioning and cultural services are included in the management plans of the protected areas under a different terminology, regulating services are barely addressed. Ecosystem service delivery varies depending on several factors including the protection category of the protected areas (protection intensity), land-use intensity and geomorphological factors, among others. Therefore, we discuss that integrating ecosystem services in protected area management requires dealing with complexity, necessitating the establishment of specific goals for ecosystem service delivery, which include ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs.","NOV",2014

In this paper, we used a new approach to improve the potential of urban trees in optimizing more desirable environmental benefits. This was done by selecting the most appropriate tree species among a vast range of species based on their potential environmental function (both services and disservices) in Tabriz city, Iran. Also, three main planting scenarios (divided to six sub-scenarios) were developed so as to understand the long-term effectiveness of introducing the selected tree species in improving the environmental benefits (both urban forest structure and ES) in comparison with planting the existing tree species. The results indicate that regardless of the quantity of planting, the benefits of introducing the selected trees will be more than planting the existing species. Moreover, as the amount of the annual planting of the recommended species increases, so does the improvement in the projected tree characteristics and ES. This approach creates more opportunities which enable urban forest managers and policymakers to understand the importance of selecting the proper urban tree species when looking for a nature-based solution to promote the wellbeing of the urban population, to create more livable and ecologically sustainable cities and to mitigate urban environmental problems.",NA,NA

We performed a thorough analysis of their interaction patterns, interaction frequencies, seed viability, and characteristics of the seed shadows they produce. We found 15,087 intact seeds in 56% of the stomachs and 5,186 intact seeds in 90% of the scats analyzed, 95% of which were smaller than 10 mm in diameter. Wild pigs were the third most effective disperser among 21 extant frugivore species in a feeding trail experiment in terms of quantity of seeds removed. Gut retention time was 70 +/- 23 hr, indicating wild pigs can promote long-distance seed dispersal. Seed survival after seed handling and gut passage by wild pigs was positively related with seed size, but large seeds were spat out and only smaller seeds were defecated intact, for which we observed a positive or neutral effect on germination relative to manually de-pulped seeds. Finally, deposition of seeds was four times more frequent in unsuitable than suitable sites for seedling recruitment and establishment. Seed dispersal effectiveness by wild pigs is high in terms of the quantity of seeds dispersed but variable in terms of the quality of the service provided.

In spite of the increasing amount of experimental evidence on the importance of plant species richness for ecosystem functioning at local scales, its role on the generation of ecosystem services at scales relevant for management is still largely unknown. To foster research on this topic, we assessed expert knowledge on the role of plant diversity in the generation of services at the landscape scale. 2. We developed a survey that included three levels of organization and seven components of plant diversity; four provisioning, six regulating and four cultural services; as well as three resources and three conditions among key abiotic factors that are likely to provide a contribution to service generation equalling that of plant diversity. Eighty experts in areas of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services answered the survey. 3. The experts identified species diversity within a community and diversity of communities within the landscape as the most important levels of organization for service generation, both with positive effects. Composition and number of species were considered to be the most relevant components of plant diversity, the latter with a positive effect on services. Water availability was identified as the most important abiotic resource. 4. Our results suggest different approaches to management for sustaining the generation of services at the landscape scale. Provisioning services were perceived as largely influenced by abiotic resources and less so (although positively) by plant diversity. Regulating services were expected to strongly depend on both plant diversity and abiotic factors. A particularly strong positive effect of plant diversity was expected for the generation of cultural services. Some variation in answers could be attributed to expert background. 5. Synthesis and applications. The expert survey generated detailed information and new hypotheses on the relationship between plant diversity and services at the landscape scale. Future research is needed to test these hypotheses, yet the areas of agreement identified in this study can be used immediately, with caution, as synthetic expert knowledge at spatial scales that are relevant for management, to guide technological and policy interventions ensuring the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery.","AUG",2012

As the ecosystem service concept increasingly becomes an operational tool there is a need to account for the complexity of the relations between production and appropriation of ecosystem services. To date there has been a considerable focus on the spatial patterns of ecosystem services provision and appropriation. We propose a new way of categorizing them according to their temporal dynamics. We differentiate between linear and non-linear dynamics in both the provision and appropriation of ecosystem services. Based on our classification we suggest how temporal dynamics can be better integrated into ecosystem services research in four steps. These include setting the appropriate temporal boundaries of the system, identifying key types of dynamics of the ecosystem, assessing the spatial scale on which the dynamics play out in the system and developing measures for assessing these dynamics. Considering temporal dynamics of ecosystem services by following these steps has the potential to enable better planning of ecosystem services management and therefore, to enhance human well-being.","SEP",2018

However, studies on ecosystem services usually ignore this. Here, we test how the importance of factors related to climate regulation services varies with spatial extent (i.e., area of assessment) and how covariation among factors affects scale dependencies. Location: The Americas. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Plants. Methods: We combined a multi-model inference framework with variance partitioning to quantify the importance of factors that could potentially influence climate regulation services (i.e., albedo, evapotranspiration and primary productivity). We quantified abiotic (climate, soil, heterogeneity in soils/topography), biotic (open vegetation, forest area and biomass,plant functional traits) and anthropogenic (forest fragmentation, managed vegetation, non-vegetated surfaces) conditions and tested their importance in relation to climate regulation services at spatial extents ranging from 9 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(6) km(2). Results: We found that the importance of abiotic factors in relation to climate regulation services increases with spatial extent. However, we found no evidence for a change from primarily biotically to abiotically driven climate regulation services with increasing spatial extent. All spatial extent dependencies were heavily influenced by covariation between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. After accounting for covariation, we found a primacy of abiotic factors as drivers of climate regulation services across spatial extents. Biotic and anthropogenic factors were less important than abiotic factors, and their independent effects were conserved across spatial extents. Main conclusions: Our results show that the relative importance of abiotic factors related to climate regulation services depends on spatial extent. Biotic and anthropogenic factors are less important for climate regulation services than abiotic factors, and this hierarchy is scale invariant. Our findings suggest that spatial extent dependence needs to be quantified and assessed in climate-change mitigation projects that focus on ecosystem services.","JUL",2018

However, effects of agricultural intensification and urbanisation on important weed diversity in the West African region had received so far little attention, although in Burkina Faso and Ghana up to 90 per cent of the population depends on agriculture as a main source of income generation. Hence, our research focussed on the analysis of changes in weed assemblages' structure and function of okra fields that were cultivated under different management intensities and were embedded into the rural, peri-urban and urban environment of two West African cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Tamale (Ghana). We found a strong relationship between gender and market orientation of okra cultivation. Market orientation of okra farmers was also a major driver in shaping weed species assemblages and led to the development of a distinct weed assemblage in urban areas that even showed higher diversity in weeds' function. Morphological plant traits (life form, seed properties) were most affected by agricultural practises; distribution pattern of ecological traits (seed dispersal mode, pollination vector) seemed to be influenced additionally by environmental characteristics with less entomophilous but more ornithochorous weed species on okra fields within urban areas. Our results revealed that the management of okra was highly variable and that this variation was influenced by fariners' socioeconomic background leading to changes in soil properties. These in turn may alter the functional diversity of beneficial weed communities beyond changes in species richness by potentially harming the provisioning of ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination.

We measured pollination benefits to yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25, 50, 100%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization (from 0 to 150 kg N ha(-1)) in an experiment under realistic soil field conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by approximately 25% compared with complete pollinator exclusion. Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were reduced by 50%, indicating that the incremental contribution of pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems.

Here, we present a new approach for mapping ecosystem service potential for multiple services when the details necessary for full quantification are unobtainable.

However, little is known about what drives the variability of functional traits in forest understories. Here, we assessed the role of different environmental drivers in shaping the functional trait distribution of understorey herbs in fragmented forests across three spatial scales. We focused on 708 small, deciduous forest patches located in 16 agricultural landscape windows, spanning a 2500-km macroclimatic gradient across the temperate forest biome in Europe. We estimated the relative effect of patch-scale, landscape-scale and macroclimatic variables on the community mean and variation of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Macroclimatic variables (monthly temperature and precipitation extremes) explained the largest proportion of variation in community trait means (on average 77% of the explained variation). In contrast, patch-scale factors dominated in explaining community trait variation (on average 68% of the explained variation). Notably, patch age, size and internal heterogeneity had a positive effect on the community-level variability. Landscape-scale variables explained only a minor part of the variation in both trait distribution properties. The variation explained by shared combinations of the variable groups was generally negligible. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in predictions of environmental-change effects on the functionality of forest understories. We propose that forest management sustainability could benefit from conserving larger, historically continuous and internally heterogeneous forest patches to maximise ecosystem service diversity in rural landscapes.

These nutrient provisioning and soil building processes are inherently in conflict; management practices that create spatial separation between them may enable each to occur effectively within a single growing season, thereby supporting high crop yield while avoiding soil depletion. Soil functional zone management (SFZM), an understudied but increasingly adopted strategy for annual row-crop production, may help meet this agroecological challenge by creating spatial heterogeneity in biophysical conditions between crop rows and inter-rows. However, the process-level effects of this spatial heterogeneity on nutrient provisioning and soil building processes have not been characterised. We assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in model SFZM (ridge tillage) and conventional tillage (chisel plough) systems in four US states encompassing a major global agricultural production region. For soil building we measured bulk density, aggregation and permanganate oxidisable carbon (PDXC); for nutrient provisioning we measured microbial decomposition activity, nutrient mineralisation and plant-available nitrogen. After two years, PDXC increased under ridge tillage (0-20 cm depth) compared with chisel plough. Ridge tillage also enhanced nutrient provisioning processes in crop rows, increasing plant-available nitrogen in synchrony with maize peak nitrogen demand. Structural equation modelling revealed that improvement in soil building processes under ridge tillage caused rapid enhancement of nutrient provisioning processes in SOM-poor soils. Increases in crop row PDXC stimulated microbial decomposition activity, which was associated with increased plant-available nitrogen during the phase of maize peak nitrogen demand. The decimetre-scale spatial heterogeneity created by ridge tillage enables reconciliation of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in row-crop agroecosystems. In doing so, ridge tillage promotes critical soil processes necessary for increasing the range of ecosystem services provided by intensive production systems. SFZM approaches may have particular value in regions with SOM-poor soils, which would benefit from rapid increases in surface organic carbon. Also, by concentrating and promoting nutrient provisioning processes around crop roots during crop peak nitrogen demand, ridge tillage may enhance nitrogen-use efficiency and reduce current fertiliser requirements.

However, management applications remain limited in part because we lack measurements linking ecosystem characteristics (ecosystem structure and processes) to final ecosystem services. Policymakers need marginal values, changes in final ecosystem services (direct link to human welfare) relative to additional units of ecosystem characteristics ( increment final ecosystem services/ increment ecosystem characteristics) to assess tradeoffs. Progress, however, has been slow due to confusion on ecological production functions (EPFs) in ecology. Here, we apply a new interdisciplinary approach to craft EPFs to evaluate four ecosystem services using the Yongding River Green Ecological Corridor as our case study. The Yongding Corridor is Beijing's largest, most expensive green infrastructure project (similar to $2.5 billion USD), constructed as a network of seven artificial lakes and wetlands. The Beijing Government wants the Yongding Corridor to improve four ecosystem services: (1) water storage, (2) local climate regulation, (3) water purification, and (4) aesthetics. We first worked with stakeholders to determine final ecosystem service levels and then used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to estimate key ecosystem processes from the designed lakes and wetlands. We coupled the modeling with ecological field data and social surveys to create EPFs. We evaluated the ecosystem services by calculating shortfalls and then determined synergies and tradeoffs to identify actions for reducing shortfalls. We found the Yongding Corridor is meeting desired levels for aesthetics, but incurred shortfalls on the remaining services. To obtain the desired services, we recommend managers: (1) maintain inflow rates and/or make the lakes deeper to reduce water loss rates; (2) improve water quality-wetlands have high nutrient retention, but nutrient loads must be reduced; and (3) plant shade trees since evaporative cooling from the lakes and wetlands is having no measurable impact on human comfort. Results indicate the absence of ecosystem functions in landscape design led to shortfalls, but solutions require coupling green and built infrastructure to obtain multi-functionality. Managers found marginal values useful for clarifying connections, which led to adaptive policy changes for improving green infrastructure.","NOV",2018

Patrick","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","1. Declines in diversity among populations managed together have diminished aggregate stability through a decreased portfolio effect. Although the portfolio effect has been quantified in a variety of ways, management recommendations for the recovery of lost diversity rarely specify the stability benefits possible through such improvements. 2. We introduce a metric, the Diversity Deficit (DD), that relates past losses and potential gains in aggregate stability to the changes in population diversity (i.e. covariability among population time series). We illustrate the use of this metric in retrospective analyses of the aggregate Sacramento River Fall-run Chinook salmon stock (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and project potential future improvements in stability through population diversity. 3. In the retrospective analysis, we removed individual time series from the stability calculations to determine their effects on times and locations of past losses in diversity and stability. We found an early threefold loss in stock stability resulting from the presence of a single tributary, the Sacramento River mainstem. Other shifts in stability resulted from an increase in variability of a single population, and from the synchronizing effects of low ocean survival that led to the 2008-2009 fishery closure. Only one, smaller increase in the DD (i.e. in lost stability) was due to portfolio-wide increases in covariabilities among tributary abundances. 4. In a prospective analysis using the DD applied to California salmon, we found that increasing biodiversity to the point of population independence and to its early high value would have reduced the probability of triggering a fishery closure. 5. Synthesis and applications. Analyses with the Diversity Deficit (DD) metric illustrate a way to identify the times and locations of losses in population diversity, and to quantify how much restoration of population diversity could increase stability, and thus benefit resource services. In our research, the benefit was a reduction in the probability of falling below a critical management threshold leading to fishery closure, but other tangible benefits (e.g. reduction in probability of extinction) would also be possible.","MAR",2018

However, habitat heterogeneity may influence the efficacy of such restoration activities. In this study, we collected macrobenthos and sediment samples to document the ecological responses of three areas in China's Yellow River Delta Wetlands with different landscape heterogeneity: planted Phragmites australis wetland (vegetation), a Suaeda heteroptera mudflat (mudflat), and bare ground. Freshwater was released annually from July to August. The sediment salinity decreased similarly in all three areas after freshwater releases, despite significant differences in salinity before the freshwater releases. The pre- and post-release composition of the macrobenthos community (based on number of individuals) showed little change in the vegetation habitat, but the dominant mudflat species changed from Crustacea to Insecta; in bare ground where no species were found before the releases, Insecta, Crustacea, and Polychaetes appeared during and after the releases. The macrobenthos abundance and biomass generally increased after the freshwater releases, except in the mudflat habitat. The H', D, and d biodiversity indices increased significantly in the vegetation habitat, but no index changed significantly in the mudflat habitat. The post-release H', J, and D indices for bare ground were close to those for the vegetation habitat, and the d index was close to that for mudflat habitat. Our results showed a generally positive effect of freshwater releases, but suggest that adaptive freshwater releases (a long-term, habitat- and species-based freshwater release plan) will be necessary to achieve sustainable wetland biodiversity and improve the efficiency of freshwater utilization.

Restored wetlands have the potential to remove external nitrogen through denitrification, but incomplete denitrification may increase nitrous oxide (N2O) release. In order to comprehensively understand nitrogen removal and N2O emission processes in restored wetlands, we conducted carbon (anhydrous sodium acetate) and nitrogen (sodium nitrate) addition experiments in the Fengxian coastal wetland site. These experiments explored the roles of external nitrogen, carbon sources, and wetland plants in nitrogen removal and N2O emission. With the addition of nitrogen, the removal of external nitrogen was significant at the restored wetland site, but led to increasing N2O release.

D.","JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY","Oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in tropical areas, although the nature of the impacts on the functional roles of the different species in the ecosystem is poorly understood. The present study is the first assessment of how oil palm affects the functional diversity of birds in the Brazilian Amazon and tests the hypothesis that converting forest to oil palm decreases functional diversity of bird communities, selecting species more tolerant to environmental disturbances. We conducted point counts to survey bird communities in 16 plots in the eastern Amazon. We sampled 32 points in riparian forest, 128 in oil palm and 160 in forested habitats. To test whether the conversion of forest into oil palm plantations affects functional diversity of birds we calculated the FD (Functional Diversity) and FRic (Functional Richness) indices. To examine whether oil palm plantations select species functionally more similar than expected by chance we used a null model (SES.FD). FD was significantly higher in the forest plots in comparison with riparian forests and oil palm, and lower in oil palm when compared with riparian forests. FRic, in turn, was greater in forest plots than in oil palm and in riparian forest. These results show that the conversion of forested areas to oil palm represents a great loss of functional strategies. The SES values indicate that in forested habitats bird communities tend to be functionally clustered while in the oil palm they are functionally overdispersed. The functional traits most affected by oil palm were those associated with diet and foraging stratum. In short, oil palm plantations reduced functional diversity of birds, although the presence of riparian forests within the plantations and the fragments of forest adjacent are extremely important for the maintenance of ecosystem services.","NOV",2016

The extent to which the locations that are most valuable for ecosystem services coincide with those that support the most biodiversity is of critical importance when designing conservation and land management strategies. There are, however, few studies on which to base any kind of conclusion about possible spatial patterns of association between ecosystem services and biodiversity. Moreover, little is known about the sensitivity of the conclusions to the quality of the data available, or to the choice and size of the region used for analysis. Here, we first present national-scale estimates of the spatial covariance in areas important for ecosystem services and biodiversity (richness of species of conservation concern), using Britain as a case study. We then explore how these associations are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the available data, the spatial extent of our study region and to regional variation across the study area. Our analyses reveal a mixture of negative and positive associations. In particular, the regionalization analysis shows that one can arrive at diametrically opposing conclusions about relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity by studying the same question within different areas, even within a moderately small island. Synthesis and applications. In a policy context, the location-specific nature of relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity underscores the importance of multi-scale environmental decision-making, so as to reflect both local conditions and broader-scale priorities. The results also suggest that efforts to establish general patterns of congruence in ecosystem services and biodiversity may offer a less constructive way forward than do more regional approaches.","AUG",2009

Travis; Aplet, Gregory H.","ECOSPHERE","Understanding the complex and reciprocal ways in which ecosystem functions (such as productivity) and biodiversity interact may provide important insights into sustaining ecosystem services and protecting species diversity. Despite years of research, observed relationships between productivity and biodiversity have been varied and hypotheses explaining patterns are diverse and equivocal. The ways in which patterns of productivity-biodiversity relationships can inform conservation may depend on understanding how gradients in human land use map onto gradients of productivity and biodiversity. Here, we used diverse publicly available spatial datasets on ecosystem productivity, tree diversity, climate, and land cover to explore two broad questions in ecoregions of Montana: (1) what is the relationship between productivity and tree diversity and (2) are land use gradients (from timber harvesting to wilderness protection) related to gradients of productivity and diversity? We also investigated the possible climatic and topographic drivers of these ecological and anthropogenic patterns. We found the most productive ecoregions support greater numbers of tree species, which appears to be influenced by precipitation but not temperature gradients. The most productive and diverse ecoregions included greater amounts of timber harvesting disturbance and associated road densities. The amount of protected area within ecoregions was highest at intermediate levels of productivity and diversity and was strongly related to mean elevation of ecoregions. Our results suggest that climate-influenced productivity gradients may influence patterns of biodiversity and are related to patterns in human land use. Further, given the existing conditions and current distribution of protected areas, we recommend that the most altered productive and diverse ecoregions may offer opportunities both for additional protection and for holistic restoration programs.","FEB",2014

Four management practices were assessed in a 30-year trial in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Transcriptional activity of bacterial 16S rRNA genes increased in noncovered soils, indicating higher microbial maintenance requirements to thrive in less favorable environmental conditions. The 16S rRNA transcript: gene copy ratio confirmed this assumption and pointed toward a much higher constitutive expression from rRNA operons in noncovered soils and to even higher expression levels when spontaneous vegetation was removed chemically. As described for 16S rRNA, potential transcription did not reveal the real transcription of bacterial beta-glucosidase genes, and higher gene expression in noncovered soils plus herbicides was evidenced. Since no relationship between total or soluble organic carbon and bacterial beta-glucosidase transcription was found, the above hypothesis could indicate either that soluble organic carbon is not the main pool of enzyme-inducing substrates or that constitutive production of bacterial beta-glucosidase enzymes increases as soil conditions worsen.","APR",2012

One of the primary responses of human societies to biodiversity loss has been the creation of protected areas. Two of the most important questions in conservation biology are: (1) whether protected areas are playing their intended role as reservoirs of biodiversity; and (2) whether habitat outside protected areas, particularly in agricultural landscapes, plays a significant role in maintaining biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it provides. Even though empirical evidence is still lacking on the exact mapping from functional group richness to specific ecosystem services, functional groups are good indicators of ecosystem functioning and thus service provision. We classified the South African avifauna into nine functional groups and tested at a coarse grain for differences in functional group composition between landscapes containing predominantly agricultural vs. protected areas. We used a matched pair sampling design to control for confounding variance. We found that avian functional groups respond in quantitatively and qualitatively distinct ways to agriculturally dominated landscapes. Raptors and scavengers displayed the most consistent losses, while nutrient dispersers and grazers tended to increase. Spatial detrending and randomisation tests suggested that only raptors and scavengers are negatively affected by agricultural landscapes independently of spatial autocorrelation. Thus, protected area landscapes are serving as important reservoirs of functionally important upper trophic populations while agricultural landscapes facilitate the presence of species that link aquatic and terrestrial systems. These results demonstrate the potential for complementary facets of functional diversity to exist on landscapes containing vastly different land-uses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Based upon existing datasets, a spatial and statistical analysis of relationships between public semi-natural spaces, urban landscapes and socioeconomic profiles of households was carried out. We compare their spatial patterns, which vary considerably. Mean income per vegetal and landscape cluster and correlations between income, ecological parameters and building density show complex and non-linear relationships. According to Multiple Correspondence Analysis, clusters of public semi-natural spaces. floristic richness and ecological diversity are associated with specific household socioeconomic profiles and landscape design. In the western built-up Haussmann districts inhabited by well-off households, public semi natural spaces provide low ecosystem services. Conversely, in the eastern and peripheral quarters where lower-income households live, public semi-natural spaces provide higher ecosystem services. It is not only well-off households which benefit from being close to urban parks and waterways. Blue and green frames cross districts inhabited by different household profiles. The implications of such results on inequalities between city-dwellers depends whether the presence of public semi-natural spaces actually improves their quality of life.

Managing sustainability of ES use requires linking services to the parts of ecosystems supplying them. We specified marine service providing units (SPUs) as plausible combinations of a biotic group (e.g., bacteria, seabirds) with an associated major habitat (e.g., sublittoral sediment). We developed a network model for large marine ecosystems, documenting 2,916 links between 153 SPUs with 31 services. Coastal habitats and their taxa accounted for 48% of links, but all habitats with their taxa contribute to at least 20 ESs. Through network analysis, we showed some services link to certain key habitats, while others are less clearly defined in space, being supported by a variety of habitats and their taxa. Analysis highlighted large-scale flows across marine habitats that are essential in underpinning continued supply of certain ESs, for example, seed dispersal. If we only protect habitats where services are used, we will not fully protect the supply of services reliant on mobile taxa moving between habitats. This emerged because we considered habitats and their taxa together. We recommend using combinations of habitats and taxa as SPUs when informing marine ecosystem management and conservation.","OCT",2018

Although there is growing insight that urban ecosystems need to be protected, there is hardly any attention for the consequences (of both pressures and protection efforts) for vulnerable human population groups. We aim to understand how urban development affects the well-being of the urban poor, through shifts in ecosystem services (ES) and people's responses to these shifts. We performed household interviews and group mapping sessions in seven urban lake communities in Bangalore, India. Changes at Bangalore's lakes can be summarized by three trends: privatization followed by conversion, pollution followed by degradation, and restoration followed by gentrification. Over time, this resulted in a shift in the types of ES supplied and demanded, the nature of use, and de facto governance: from provisioning, communal and public; to cultural, individual, and private. Lake dwellers responded by finding (other) sources of income, accepting lower quality or less accessible ES, and/or completely stopping the use of certain ES. The consequences of ecosystem change for people's well-being differ depending on a household's ability to adapt and on individual circumstances, land tenure and financial capital in particular. To guarantee a future for Bangalore's lakes, restoration seems the only viable option. Although beautiful lake parks may be a solution for the well-off and not-too-poor, leaving the very poor without options to adapt to the new circumstances puts them at risk of becoming even more marginalized. We show that ecosystem degradation and restoration alike can impact the well-being of the urban poor. People's experiences allowed us to couple ecosystem change to well-being through ES and adaptation strategies. Hence, we revealed multiple cause-effect relations.

M.","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","Tractable practices for soil microbial restoration in tallgrass prairies reclaimed from agriculture are a critical gap in traditional ecological restoration. Long-term fertilization and tilling permanently alter soil bacterial and fungal communities, requiring microbe-targeted restoration methods to improve belowground ecosystem services and carbon storage in newly restored prairies. These techniques are particularly important when restoring for climate-ready ecosystems, adapted to altered temperature regimes. To approach these issues, we conducted a multi-factorial greenhouse experiment to test the effects of plant species richness, soil amendment and elevated temperature on soil microbial diversity, growth, and function. Treatments consisted of three seedlings of one plant species (Andropogon gerardii) or one seedling each of three plant species (A. gerardii, Echinacea pallida, Coreopsis lanceolata). Soil amendments included cellulose addition, inoculation with a microbial community collected from an undisturbed remnant prairie, and a control. We assessed microbial communities using extracellular enzyme assays, Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, predicted bacterial metabolic pathways from sequence data and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), which includes both bacterial and fungal lipid abundances. Our results indicate that addition of cellulose selects for slow-growing bacterial taxa (Verruconticrobia) and fungi at ambient temperature. However, at elevated temperature, selection for slow-growing bacterial taxa is enhanced, while selection for fungi is lost, indicating temperature sensitivity among fungi. Cellulose addition was a more effective means of altering soil community composition than addition of microbial communities harvested from a remnant prairie. Soil water content was typically higher in the A. gerardii treatment alone, regardless of temperature, but at ambient temperature only, predicted metagenomics pathways for bacterial carbon metabolism were more abundant with A. gerardii. In summary, these results from a mesocosm test case indicate that adding cellulose to newly restored soil and increasing the abundance of C-4 grasses, such as A. gerardii, can select for microbial communities adapted for slow growth and carbon storage. Further testing is required to determine if these approaches yield the same results in a field-level experiment.","APR",2019

However, in highly dynamic landscapes, such as some tropical regions, ecosystem services are potentially affected not only by the present landscape structure, but also by the historical land use. Here we propose a simple methodological framework to evaluate the contribution of past landscape dynamics and present landscape structure in the provision of ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a traditional agricultural landscape from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, where natural forests cover has increased from 8 to 16 % in the last 60 years (1962-2008), and where old forests are being reduced while young forests are being regenerated. Forests of different ages, in association with current landscape structure, reveal a mosaic of forest patches under different conditions, implying different abilities to deliver ecosystem services. With the replacement of old-growth forests by young-regenerating forests and a high level of forest fragmentation, less than 1/4 of the current forest cover is able to fully satisfy the ecosystem service demands. To avoid such tendency, government policies should not only focus on increasing forest cover, but also in conserving old-growth forest fragments or increasing forest quality. The proposed methodology allows integrating historical land use and current landscape structure to evaluate ecosystem services provision and can be useful to establish programs of payment for ecosystem services.","FEB",2014

Functional diversity can stabilize ecosystem function over time if one group of species compensates for an environmentally driven decline in another. Although intuitively appealing, evidence for this pattern is mixed. We hypothesized that diverse functional responses to rainfall will increase the stability of vegetation cover and biomass across rainfall conditions, but that this effect depends on land-use legacies that maintain functional diversity. We experimentally manipulated grazing in a California grassland to create land-use legacies of low and moderate grazing, across which we implemented rainout shelters and irrigation to create dry and wet conditions over 3 years. We found that the stability of the vegetation cover was greatly elevated and the stability of the biomass was slightly elevated across rainfall conditions in areas with histories of moderate grazing. Initial functional diversity-both in the seed bank and aboveground-was also greater in areas that had been moderately grazed. Rainfall conditions in conjunction with this grazing legacy led to different functional diversity patterns over time. Wet conditions led to rapid declines in functional diversity and a convergence on resource-acquisitive traits. In contrast, consecutively dry conditions maintained but did not increase functional diversity over time. As a result, grazing practices and environmental conditions that decrease functional diversity may be associated with lasting effects on the response of ecosystem functions to drought. Our results demonstrate that theorized relationships between diversity and stability are applicable and important in the context of working grazed landscapes.",NA,2017

Given that flooding may increase with climate change and reforestation will increase resiliency to climate change, we tested whether reforested floodplains also have great potential to store carbon and the effects of even modest increases in forested acreage on carbon storage. To calculate potential above-ground biomass in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the United States, we determined current and historical tree biomass used density estimates and diameter distributions from tree surveys and relationships between diameter and biomass from current forests. To calculate potential soil organic carbon if the landscape was forested, we used soil organic matter from soil surveys of the agricultural landscape, and multiplied the carbon by a factors of 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 based on published reports of soil carbon increases due to afforestation. Our results showed that area-weighted mean biomass density (trees >= 12.7 cm in diameter) for historical forests was 300 Mg/ha, ranging from 228 Mg/ha to 332 Mg/ha by ecological subsection, based on the most conservative diameter distribution. Mean biomass density for current forests was 97 Mg/ha, ranging from 92 Mg/ha to 111 Mg/ha. Mean carbon density for agricultural soils was 96 Mg/ha, whereas combined tree and soil carbon densities varied from 169 Mg/ha to 317 Mg/ha; soil carbon accounted for 0.5-0.7 of total carbon density. Historical forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV was about 234 TgC, with the most conservative diameter distribution and assuming 80% forest coverage. Current forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV is about 2% of historical storage, at 5 TgC in 30,000 ha of forests, but may reach 23 TgC if forested extent almost triples, with the addition of 50,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, and carbon storage increases in trees and soil. The entire LMAV currently stores 97 TgC in forests and reasonable carbon storage for the entire LMAV may be about 335 TgC, based on increased carbon storage and reforestation of 600,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, which would double the current forested extent.

We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models. Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as large-scale management intervention and policy assessment.","MAR",2017

LocationTwenty cities across the USA and Canada. MethodsWe examined variation in tree community taxonomic diversity, origins and production of an aesthetic ecosystem service trait in a cross-section of urban field surveys. We correlated urban tree community composition indicators with a key climate restriction, namely mean minimum winter temperature, and evaluated alternative possible drivers: precipitation, summer maximum temperature, population size and the percentage of adults with a college education. ResultsSpecies accumulation curves differed substantially among cities, with observed richness varying from 22 to 122 species. Similarities in tree communities decreased exponentially with increases in climatic differences. Ordination of tree communities showed strong separation among cities with component axes correlated with minimum winter temperature and annual precipitation. Variation among urban tree communities in richness, origins and the provisioning of an aesthetic ecosystem service were all correlated with minimum winter temperature. Main conclusionsThe urban climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis provides a coherent mechanism to explain the large variation among urban tree communities resulting from an interacting environment, species and human decisions. Reconciling the feedbacks between human decision making and biophysical limitations provides a foundation for an urban ecological theory that can better understand and predict the dynamics of other linked biotic communities, associated ecosystem dynamics and resulting services provided to urban residents.","NOV",2016

However, beyond the multiple modelling approaches, we lack empirical evidence of contemporary climate change impacts on populations in broad taxonomic groups and at continental scales. Identifying reliable predictors of species resilience or susceptibility to climate warming is of critical importance in assessing potential risks to species, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here we analysed long-term trends of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (20 countries), to identify climate niche characteristics, adjusted to other environmental and life history traits, that predict large-scale population changes accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. Beyond the now well-documented decline of farmland specialists, we found that species with the lowest thermal maxima (as the mean spring and summer temperature of the hottest part of the breeding distribution in Europe) showed the sharpest declines between 1980 and 2005. Thermal maximum predicted the recent trends independently of other potential predictors. This study emphasizes the need to account for both land-use and climate changes to assess the fate of species. Moreover, we highlight that thermal maximum appears as a reliable and simple predictor of the long-term trends of such endothermic species facing climate change.","FEB",2010

However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

A spatially explicit approach is needed to develop specific recommendations regarding the design of agricultural landscapes to sustain wild pollinator communities and the services they provide. I modeled pollination services in agroecosystems using a pair of models: a stochastic individual-based simulation model of wild pollinators, pollinator-dependent plants, and crop pollination; and a set of coupled difference equations designed to capture the nonspatial component of the simulation model. Five spatially explicit models of habitat conversion to crops were simulated, and results for pollination services were compared. Mean-field behavior of the simulation model was in good agreement with analysis of the difference equations. A major feature of the models was the presence of a cusp leading to loss of stability and extinction of pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants beyond a critical amount of habitat loss. The addition of pollen obtained from crop visitation caused a breakdown of the cusp preventing extinction of pollinators, but not of wild pollinator-dependent plants. Spatially restricted foraging and dispersal also altered model outcomes relative to mean-field predictions, in some cases causing extinction under parameter settings that would otherwise lead to persistence. Different patterns of habitat conversion to crops resulted in different levels of pollination services. Most interesting was the finding that optimal pollination services occurred when the size of remnant habitat patches was equal to half the mean foraging and dispersal distance of pollinators and the spacing between remnant patches was equal to the mean foraging and dispersal distance. Conservation of wild pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants in agroecosystems requires careful attention to thresholds in habitat conversion and spatial pattern and scale of remnant habitats. Maximization of pollination services was generally incompatible with conservation of wild pollinator-dependent plants. My prediction is that pollination services will be maximized by providing islands of nesting habitat where interisland distance matches mean foraging distances of wild pollinators.","SEP",2009

Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover.

The field of spatial conservation prioritisation explores allocation of conservation effort, including for reserve network expansion, targeting habitat restoration, or minimising ecological impacts of development. Inevitably, the utility of such planning depends on the quantity and quality input data, including spatial information on biodiversity, threats, and cost of action. In this work we systematically develop understanding about the significance of these different data types in spatial conservation prioritisation. We clarify the common ways different data types enter an analysis, develop mathematical models to understand the effects of data in spatial prioritisation, and survey literature to establish typical quantities of different types of data used. We use Jackknife analysis to derive the expected change in site values, when a single new data layer is added to a prioritisation. We validate mathematical formulae for expected impacts using simulations. A survey of scientific literature reveals that typical spatial prioritisation analyses include hundreds of biodiversity feature layers (species, habitat types, ecosystem services), but the count of cost, threat or habitat condition layers is typically 0-5. Due to these differences, and the mathematical formulations commonly used to combine data types, the influence of a single cost, threat, or habitat condition data layer can be an order or two higher than the influence of a single biodiversity feature layer. In a classical cost-effectiveness formulation (benefits divided by costs, B/C) the influence of a single cost layer can even be as large as the joint influence of thousands of species distributions. We also clarify how changes in data impact site values and spatial priority rankings differently, with the latter being further influenced by data correlations, the spread of numeric values inside data layers and other data characteristics. For example, costs influence priorities significantly if cost is positively correlated with biodiversity, but the correlation is the other way around for biodiversity and habitat condition. This work helps conservation practitioners to direct efforts when collating data for spatial conservation planning. It also helps decision makers understand where to focus attention when interpreting conservation plans and their uncertainties.","NOV",2018

The resolving of current eco-environmental problems calls for better understanding of the spatially explicit ES interactions to guide targeted land-use policy-making. We propose a framework to map ES in continuous time-series, based on which we further quantify interactions among multiple ES. The supply of three key ES-soil conservation (SC), net primary production (NPP) and water yield (WY)-were quantified and mapped at fine-resolution from 2000 to 2013 using easily-accessible spatial data. Pairwise ES interactions were quantified using a spatio-temporal statistical method. Spatio-temporal analyses of ES dynamics illustrated that the supply of the three ES increased over the past 14 years in northern Shaanxi, where land cover dramatically changed owing to the wide-range ecological restoration projects. Our results also revealed that ES interactions varied across locations due to landscape heterogeneity and climate difference. In the arid and semi-arid area, synergies among ES (e.g., SC vs. WY) tended to dominate in grassland, while in artificial lands ES were prone to show trade-offs. In the semi-humid area, pairwise ES (e.g., NPP vs. WY) in woodland tended to present synergies. The spatio-temporal variation of ES and their interactions resulted from coupling effect of human-induced climate and land-use change. In the long-term, spatially explicit quantification of ES interactions can help identify spatial heterogeneity in ES trade-offs and synergies, and inform regional targeted land-use policy adjustment and sustainable ecosystem management.","JUN",2017

Six ecosystem service indicators were selected and quantified using process-based models, including net primary production (NPP), grain production, net oxygen production (NOP), carbon sequestration (CS), water conservation, and soil conservation. Analytical results were as follows: (1) At the oasis scale, NPP, NOP, CS, water conservation, and soil conservation decreased from 2000 to 2009, whereas grain production increased. (2) At the pixel scale, the spatial changes in NPP were similar to those in NOP and CS, but changes in grain production showed the opposite pattern. Water conservation and soil conservation showed somewhat unintuitive spatial patterns.

We studied a eutrophic lowland river used for drinking water and recreation to identify the maximal sustainable extent of human use. We recorded filtration by mussels and modeled the disturbance to mussels caused by wave action induced from recreational boating. Filtration was significantly affected by shear stress produced from boats down to a depth of 2.7 m. Threshold values for the intensity of wave disturbance ranged from 0.21 N/m(2) (Unio tumidus) to 0.43 N/m(2) (Anodonta anatina) for moderate effects and from 0.02 N/m(2) (U. tumidus) to 0.13 N/m(2) (Dreissena polymorpha) for no effects on filtration. Anodonta anatina and D. polymorpha showed a significantly lower degree of shell closing and a higher predicted medium-effect shear stress (the shear stress associated with 50% of the maximum shell closing duration) than U. tumidus and Unio pictorum, which probably results from differences in the species position in and above the sediment. Coupled hydraulic ecological modeling showed that typical boating activity may reduce self-purification activity by mussels, with the extent of disturbance depending on mussel species, river depth, boating frequency, and cruising speed. Single passages of boats reduced daily mussel filtration rates by 0.02% for muscle-driven boats, 0.45% for yachts, 0.68% for motor boats, and 0.69% for motorized rafting and rowing boats. Depending on total daily boat traffic and hydrological conditions, a reduction in the daily filtration rate by mussel populations within the studied river section was estimated at 6.9%. We conclude that self-purification activity of this lowland river section is not significantly affected by recreational boating, but might be affected by more intense recreational boating under altered river flow conditions.","MAR",2013

We conducted RLQ analyses to examine the association between avian functional traits and microhabitat structures present at each survey site. There was no significant difference in vegetation structure nor species richness between IF and TDB. Species with specialised ecological niches (e.g. large-bodied frugivores; small-bodied insectivores, cavity-nesters) were present in both IF and TDB, indicating that TDB in Durban represents an advanced stage of forest regeneration.

A particular challenge is to reconcile demand for increased food production with provision of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. Using a spatially extensive data base (covering Great Britain) of co-located biophysical measurements (collected in the Countryside Survey), we explore the relationships between ecosystem service indicators and biodiversity across a temperate ecosystem productivity gradient. Each service indicator has an individual response curve demonstrating that simultaneous analysis of multiple ecosystem services is essential for optimal service management. The shape of the response curve can be used to indicate whether land sharing' (provision of multiple services from the same land parcel) or land sparing' (single service prioritization) is the most appropriate option. Soil carbon storage and above-ground net primary production indicators were found to define opposing ends of a primary gradient in service provision. Biodiversity and water quality indicators were highest at intermediate levels of both factors, consistent with a unimodal relationship along a productivity gradient. Positive relationships occurred between multiple components of biodiversity, measured as taxon richness of all plants, bee and butterfly nectar plants, soil invertebrates and freshwater macroinvertebrates, indicating potential for management measures directed at one aspect of biodiversity to deliver wider ecosystem biodiversity. We demonstrate that in temperate, human-dominated landscapes, ecosystem services are highly constrained by a fundamental productivity gradient. There are immediate trade-offs between productivity and soil carbon storage but potential synergies with services with different shaped relationships to production. Synthesis and applications. Using techniques such as response curves to analyse multiple service interactions can inform the development of Spatial Decision Support tools and landscape-scale ecosystem service management options. At intermediate productivity, land-sharing' would optimize multiple services, however, to deliver significant soil carbon storage land-sparing' is required, that is, resources focused in low productivity areas with high carbon to maximize investment return. This study emphasizes that targets for services per unit area need to be set within the context of the national gradients reported here to ensure best use of limited resources.","JUN",2013

Social conflict arises among landholders with different preferences for ecosystem services and land-use practices in agricultural frontiers of the Argentine Dry Chaco. We explored policy and management options by assessing the actual and potential outcomes of alternative land-use systems and scenarios. We first constructed the efficiency frontier for avian habitat and agricultural productivity to analyze the combinations of ecosystem services that can be achieved under different land-use intensities. A nonlinear, concave efficiency frontier indicated opportunities to achieve large gains for production with small losses for conservation, for instance, by transitioning from low-to intermediate-intensity systems. Second, we projected production and conservation outcomes, which can be achieved through the implementation of five alternative policy options. The land sharing with conservation scenario, 70% of the landscape covered by intermediate-intensity systems and 30% by undisturbed forests, yielded the higher combination of avian habitat and agricultural productivity. Third, we constructed indifference curves of three landholder groups, i.e., preproductivist, multifunctional, and productivist, by assessing their intentions (proxies for preferences) to conserve and convert remnant forests in their landholdings. Multifunctional landholders showed balanced preferences for conserving and converting forests in their landholdings, and maintaining intermediate-intensity systems. A general willingness to conserve forests coexisted in preproductivist landholders with the intention to clear some portions of the landholding and intensify landuse, indicating the potential of an endogenously motivated transition toward a multifunctional regime. Such transition may increase their productivity by 35-65% without compromising avian habitat. Productivist landholders showed a strong inclination toward converting forests for pasture cultivation, despite the observation that they can increase their conservation outcomes by 30-50% without significantly reducing productivity by transitioning toward a multifunctional regime. Promoting this transition will require exogenous incentives and regulations tailored to the behavior of this landholder group.",NA,2015

We surveyed the preferences and perceived benefits of 1849 people in 89 fish landing sites for 6 common restrictions of increasing severity. Variability in perceived benefits within and between neighboring communities was evaluated to determine how perceptions changed with the severity of the proposed benefit/cost restriction scale, perceived benefits, disparities between beneficiaries, and national context. Within-community variability declined strongly (r(2) > 0.90) as perceived benefit increased but was either weak or not significantly associated with the neighbor-community's variation. Within-community variation was less than between-community variation and differed by nation. There was generally broader scale agreement on the benefits of weaker restrictions of minimum sizes of fish and allowable fishing gear and more disagreement on stronger restrictions on species, time, and space use. Reduced variability was strongly associated with less perceived disparity in the benefits received by local versus government beneficiaries. These findings indicate potential conflicts between neighboring communities for most, but particularly the strongest, restrictions.

We examined how natural and human features of a landscape influence the distribution of argali sheep in Itch Nart Nature Reserve, Mongolia, a popular destination for tourists seeking the opportunity to see and experience this declining species. We collected 1999 argali locations from 2009 to 2011 and developed an occupancy model for each season and across seasons. Occupancy probability equates to the chance of seeing the species, and provides a measure that not only describes the distribution of argali, but also the cultural service they provide. We developed a set of 67 candidate models and the top-ranking model each season and across seasons was the interaction of proximity to water and proportion of rocky outcrop at a site. Argali occupancy increased as distance to water decreased and amount of rocky outcrop increased. The simulated removal of water sources resulted in a 98% loss in landscape quality. Our results provide among the first occupancy models for argali, which can inform decision-making at multiple spatial scales. They also reveal the importance of water sources, which are intensively used by people and livestock, and indicate that careful management of these resources will be important to sustaining argali in the landscape.

Due to complex vegetation dynamics, pasture-woodlands are very vulnerable to the currently occurring land use and climate changes. Therefore, management requires integrative long-term predictions of successional trends. We present a refined version of the spatially explicit, dynamic simulation model WoodPaM with improved climate sensitivity of simulated vegetation. We investigate pasture-woodland dynamics by applying an innovative combination of retrospective simulations starting in the Middle Ages with prospective simulations following two climate change scenarios. The retrospective simulations demonstrate the strong dependency of the landscape mosaic on both climate and management. In high elevation mountain pastures, climate cooling during the Little Ice Age hindered simulated tree regeneration and reduced forage production of grasslands. Both led to an increase in open grassland and to a structural simplification of the landscape. In turn, climate warming afterwards showed the opposite effect. At lower elevations, high cattle stocking rates generally dominate simulated succession, leading to a slow development of quite homogenous landscapes whose structures are hardly affected by historical climate variability. Aerial photographs suggest that logging and windstorms critically shaped the current landscape, both homogenizing mosaic structures that emerge from selective grazing. Simulations of climate change scenarios suggest delayed but inevitable structural changes in the landscape mosaic and a temporary breakdown of the ecosystem service wood production. The population of currently dominating Norway spruce collapses due to simulated drought. Spruce is only slowly replaced either by beech under moderate warming or by Scots pine under extreme warming. In general, the shift in tree species dominance results in landscapes of less structural richness than today. In order to maintain the mosaic structure of pasture-woodlands, we recommend a future increase in cattle stocking on mountain pastures. The (re-) introduction of mixed herds (cattle with horses, sheep, and goats) could mitigate the simulated trend towards structural homogenization of the forest-grassland mosaic because diverse browsing effects selectively control tree regeneration and would counteract simulated forest encroachment. This could prevent the loss of species-rich open grasslands and forest-grassland ecotones.

However, such systems differ greatly from annual cropping systems in terms of spatio-temporal dynamics and levels of disturbance. Identifying how land use changes at different scales affect communities and ecosystem services in those habitats is of major importance. Our objectives were to examine the effects of local and landscape agricultural intensification on ground beetle community structure and weed seed predation services. We examined the effects of local vegetation management and landscape context on ground beetle community structure and weed seed predation in 20 vineyards of southwestern France in 2013 and 2014. Vineyards were selected along a landscape complexity gradient and experienced different management of local vegetation. The activity-density of ground beetles decreased with increasing landscape complexity while species richness and evenness remained unchanged. Phytophagous and macropterous species dominated ground beetle communities. Seed predation was positively related to the activity-density of one species, Harpalus dimidiatus, and was not affected by local management or landscape context. We found that within-year temporal diversity in ground beetle assemblages increased with landscape complexity. Our study shows that increasing the proportion of semi-natural habitats in vineyard landscapes enhances the temporal diversity of ground beetles. However, we also found that measures targeting specific species delivering biological control services are a reasonable strategy if we are to maximize natural pest control services such as weed seed regulation to support crop production and reduce agrochemical use.","NOV",2016

Understanding the effects of tree species composition on productivity can inform plantation design and ecological restoration strategies. However, tree species composition effects have been neglected in experimental biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) research. This study uses a 10-yr data set from one of the first tropical planted forest experiments established with native species and designed for BEF research at scales relevant to forest management. At our site in Sardinilla, Panama, we established plots containing 6 species from a pool of 18, in four combinations, to investigate how composition affects species and plot productivity. We used basal area as a proxy for productivity through time, measured annually, and summed this at species and plot levels for analysis. We found that plots that differed in species composition appeared to differ in temporal rate of basal area increase, but did not differ in BA after 10yr. Species were generally consistent in size between compositions, and composition performance was correlated with the size of component species, suggesting that species identities were most important in determining plot productivity. Our results suggest that species choice can be based on preferences for individual species, as species performance was consistent across composition contexts. We make recommendations for the use of particularly productive species that also provide multiple services such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin, and Anacardium excelsum. Resumen Con la presion cada vez mayor sobre los bosques primarios proveniente de utilizaciones del suelo destructivas, el aumento de la diversidad de plantaciones de especies nativas puede aumentar la prestacion de servicios de los ecosistemas, tales como la produccion de madera o la captura de carbono, y por lo tanto, aumentar el apoyo a medios de vida sostenibles. La comprension de los efectos de la composicion de las especies de arboles en la productividad, puede informar sobre el diseno de plantacion y las estrategias de restauracion ecologica. Sin embargo, los efectos de la composicion de especies de arboles se han descuidado en las investigaciones de funcion experimental de la biodiversidad en los ecosistemas o BEF por sus siglas en ingles. Este estudio utiliza un conjunto de datos de 10 anos de uno de los primeros experimentos establecido en bosques tropicales con especies nativas y disenado para la investigacion BEF a escalas relevantes para la gestion forestal. En nuestro sitio en Sardinilla, Panama, establecimos parcelas que contienen seis especies de un grupo de dieciocho anos, en cuatro combinaciones, para investigar como la composicion afecta las especies y la productividad en las parcelas. Utilizamos el area basal como proxy de la productividad a traves del tiempo, medido anualmente, y esto lo sumamos al nivel de las especies y las parcelas para el analisis. Se encontro que las parcelas que diferian en la composicion de especies parecian diferir en la tasa de incremento temporal de la zona basal pero no difirieron en el area basal despues de 10 anos. Las especies fueron generalmente consistentes en tamano entre las composiciones, y el rendimiento de la composicion se correlaciono con el tamano de las especies que lo componen, lo que sugiere que la identidad de las especies fue mas importante para determinar la productividad en la parcela. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la eleccion de las especies puede estar basada en las preferencias por las distintas especies, ya que el rendimiento de especies fue consistente en contextos de composicion.

In particular, global climate is increasing sea levels and potentially altering storm intensities, which may result in increased risk of flooding in coastal areas. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), coastal dunes that protect the coast from flooding are largely the product of a grass introduced from Europe over a century ago (Ammophila arenaria). An introduced congener (A. breviligulata) is displacing A. arenaria and reducing dune height. Here we quantify the relative exposure to storm-wave induced dune overtopping posed by the A. breviligulata invasion in the face of projected multi-decadal changes in sea level and storm intensity. In our models, altered storm intensity was the largest driver of overtopping extent, however the invasion by A. breviligulata tripled the number of areas vulnerable to overtopping and posed a fourfold larger exposure than sea-level rise over multi-decadal time scales. Our work demonstrates the importance of a transdisciplinary approach that draws on insights from ecology, geomorphology, and civil engineering to assess the vulnerability of ecosystem services in light of global change.","MAR",2013

However, the extent to which dual outcomes for recreation and conservation can be achieved in the same spaces remains unclear. We examine whether greater levels of (i) tree cover (i.e. park 'greenness') and (ii) native remnant vegetation cover (i.e. vegetation with high ecological value) attract or deter park visitors. This study is based on the park visitation behaviour of 670 survey respondents in Brisbane, Australia, detailing 1,090 individual visits to 324 urban parks. We first examined the presence of any clear revealed preferences for visiting parks with higher or lower levels of tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. We then examined the differences between each park visited by respondents and the park closest to their home, and used linear mixed models to identify socio-demographic groups who are more likely to travel further to visit parks with greater tree cover or remnant vegetation cover. Park visitation rates reflected the availability of parks, suggesting that people do not preferentially visit parks with greater vegetation cover despite the potential for improved nature-based experiences and greater wellbeing benefits. However, we discovered that people with a greater orientation towards nature (measured using the nature relatedness scale) tend to travel further for more vegetated parks. Our results suggest that to enhance recreational benefits from ecologically valuable spaces a range of social or educational interventions are required to enhance people's connection to nature.","JAN",2015

We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35 degrees C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems.","NOV",2008

General principles from river-floodplain ecology may provide guidance for understanding these spatial patterns, yet such concepts have rarely been incorporated into spatial assessments of ES. Using a lens of riverine concepts, we contrasted how floodplain ES capacity and diversity (orchard production, forage production, carbon storage, paddle route quality, fish capacity) vary with longitudinal river-floodplain position. High spatial resolution aerial photography (2006) facilitated detection of floodplain features contributing to the production of ES. We also determined how river reach types are linked to production of ES. We found that ES capacity varied considerably with longitudinal position and reach type. Agricultural capacity was concentrated in lower reaches, high-quality paddle routes in middle-lower reaches, and fish capacity and carbon storage in upper reaches. Furthermore, the highest diversity of ES was concentrated in the lowland floodplain reaches. Our results suggest river-floodplain concepts can improve spatial assessments of ES, increase our understanding of the relationships among biological features and ES, and thus help us better manage some of the key ES trade-offs.","MAR",2017

We investigated the role played by the bonobo (Pan paniscus) in a human-altered forest-savanna mosaic in Democratic Republic of the Congo. The studied-groups are part of a community-based conservation programme but live at the interface with human activities. We identified dispersed species via faecal analysis, classified them into a regeneration guild and a seed size category, determined the effect of gut transit on seed germination, and the habitat use of bonobos. Bonobos dispersed intact seeds of 77 species, 80.8% of which were large-seeded (>= 10 mm long), of which few can be dispersed by sympatric frugivores. They dispersed a majority (49%) of shade-bearers that thrive in forest understory with limited amount of light, all of which were large-seeded. Transit had an overall positive effect on seed germination. Bonobos used various habitat types, showing preferences for understory with intermediate light availability and dominated by woody or herbaceous vegetation. This dispersal pattern probably enhances recruitment of shade bearers, and we thus hypothesized that those species benefited from directed dispersal by bonobos. This threatened frugivore provides unique dispersal services and likely plays a paramount functional role in the regeneration of late successional forests in this mosaic landscape. Management plans should pay particular attention to the role of large and rare frugivores in human-dominated regions as their disappearance could disrupt forest succession to a climax state.

Management of set-aside has many facets and in this perspective paper we focus on the biodiversity effects of successional age, sowing strategies and landscape context. Young, 1-2-year-old set-asides have been initially considered to be too ephemeral to have any conservation value. However, when a rich seed and bud bank is available, a species-rich natural (secondary) succession can be observed. Arable (annual) weed communities in the first two years of succession can even include endangered plant species with associated rare insect consumers. Furthermore, many bird species benefit from early-successional habitats, whereas small mammal communities are richer in older habitats. If the local plant species pool is poor, sowings of diverse mixtures from regional seed collections can be recommended. Set-aside managers using species-rich sowings often experience that dominant weeds suppress the less competitive annual species. This trend to species-poor communities can be avoided by intraspecific aggregation of competitively weak species. Broadening the spatial scale from the plot to the landscape, efficiency of set-aside is highest in simple landscapes, where set-aside exhibits greatest effect in enhancement of biodiversity and associated services such as pollination and biological control. In complex landscapes, however, additional set-aside does not add much to the high level of biodiversity and ecological processes already present. Twenty percent of semi-natural, non-crop habitat appears to be a rough threshold for enhancing biodiversity and sustaining services such as pollination and biological control, but improved set-aside management should have the potential to reduce the percentage of semi-natural non-crop habitat needed. EU policy should tailor set-aside schemes for the maintenance of biodiversity and also consider that management efficiency is higher in simple than complex landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, however, unionids are often found in turbid rivers. We predicted that clay-sized particles, which comprise > 80% of river seston (particles in suspension), were too small to affect unionid clearance rate (CR) and thus explain this conundrum. We examined this hypothesis in laboratory experiments involving four unionid species exposed to four particle-size based TSS treatments (mixed sediment: 0-63 mu m; clay: 0-5 mu m; fine silt: 5-38 mu m; coarse silt: 38-63 mu m; sourced from mussel sites) at 20 mg/L, which is a TSS concentration sufficient to reduce CR. Whereas the CR for all species was lower for mixed sediment, coarse silt and clay treatments-the latter was opposite to our prediction-the CR of mussels given the fine silt treatment was similar to the no-TSS control for two species and higher than the other TSS treatments in the other two species. Fine silt contained the most fluorescent (i.e. algal) particles and the highest protein and lipid content, which suggests that CR were higher on the more nutritious diet. Particle quality, rather than size, is what modulates suspension feeding in turbid rivers. Our current understanding of the ecological effects of bivalve suspension feeding will need to be revised to incorporate field-based measurements.","DEC",2018

This study presents a spatially explicit probabilistic approach to model and analyse the effect of landscape elements removal on landscape connectivity and heterogeneity in a case study in North-Eastern Germany. Simulation of stepwise removal of tree elements as potential landscape changes is applied to assess resulting impacts on the related ecological habitat function for the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), a representative farmland bird species. The analysis of variograms' parameters identified a turning point in landscape structure constellation, occurring at a removal of nearly 50% of the tree elements, in correspondence of a 21% reduction in heterogeneity and a 20% reduction in elements connectivity. In terms of habitat provision, the turning point appeared at a shifted level, corresponding to a 50% reduction of connectivity, resulting from a ca. 75% reduction in spatial variability. It is argued that at the turning points the agricultural landscape would reach the limits of its resilience in terms of the habitat function associated to the removed elements. Results, displayed as probability maps, highlight that a high probability of tree elements occurrence is not always coupled with a high probability of habitat provision. The approach offers planners the possibility to identify structural and functional resilience thresholds for the management of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using regression models incorporating different impact indicators (occurrence of inundation, inundation distance, and human deaths), we examined factors that significantly influenced tsunami damage in southern Sri Lanka. Land elevation (which is positively correlated with forest presence), sand dunes and coastal convexity (which deflects waves), were protective factors, in terms of whether the tsunami wave inundated within an arbitrary distance of 15 m inland. Water bodies, saltpans and built-up areas (e. g., roads, development) increased wave inundation distance, while beaches and sand dunes were ameliorative. Built-up areas also increased death toll. Bathymetry, a proxy for wave height and force, was the only significant factor in all three multivariable models. Coastal areas with a steeper seaward bathymetric slope gradient were less prone to inundation and human fatalities, which is consistent other tsunami research. The presence of coral reefs was highly correlated with bathymetric slope gradient, implying a potentially protective role by coral reefs. Many factors showing greatest protective effect against tsunami damage are geographical features that cannot easily be modified. However, some defence factors identified, such as sand dunes, could potentially be protected. Given the wide-ranging ecosystem services, unrelated to tsunami protection, ongoing loss/degradation of natural systems including mangroves (not a significant factor in the multivariable models), could be damaging. This might impede certain future coastal development options in post-tsunami Sri Lanka.","FEB",2012

In many developed countries socioeconomic changes have induced forest expansion during the last centuries, with still seldom explored implications for ecosystem services. We assessed the growth rate and the contribution of these ""new forests"" on C storage under the imprint of land-use history from Mediterranean to temperate forests in two biogeographical regions in the Iberian Peninsula, using data from 6422 plots of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986-2007) and the land-cover map of 1956 to distinguish among pre-existing and new forests (appeared after 1956). Almost a quarter of current forests were new forests and they represented 22% of the total C pool. New forests maintained similar C stocks than pre-existing ones (similar to 45 Mg ha(-1)), but they are growing at rates 25% faster. Considering the whole Spanish forested territory, the new forest growth rate would offset around 9% of the rate of total C emitted in Spain between 1986 and 2007. The effects of land-use history on forest growth and C stocks varied with environmental conditions (for example, growth of new forests in areas with less water availability was higher than in pre-existing ones), supporting the idea that agricultural legacies may prevail in the long term. In a time when European forests exhibit the first signs of carbon sink saturation, our study endows a relevant ecological role to new forests appearing in the second half of the twentieth century.","JAN",2017

Our results showed that from the creek bottom to flat soil water content declined (F-3,F-60 = 93.8, p < 0.001), and the variations of other sediment physical and chemical properties associated with the change of soil water content were significant among the microhabitats on the creek sections (p < 0.001 for pH, conductivity, and grain size). No crab burrows were found at the creek bottom. The burrows on the slope were smaller in size (p < 0 001 for burrow opening diamater) while the density was higher than that at the edge and on the flat (F-2,F-45 = 31.2, p < 0.001). Moreover, although the correlations between burrow distribution and sediment properties varied among the microhabitats on the creek sections, crabs generally selected relatively solid sediments to build their burrows. On the slope, there was a significantly negative relationship between burrow density and soil water content (r(2) = 0.53, p < 0.001). At the edge, the correlation between total burrow opening area and soil water content was significantly negative (r(2) = 0.44. p < 0.002). The density of small crab burrows (<10 mm) was greater, but that of large burrows (>10 mm) was lower in tidal creeks than in non-creek habitats. Therefore, sediment properties showed a gradual transition from hydrophytic to terrestrial environments on the creek section, which caused significant differences of burrow distribution among the microhabitats. The creeks of tidal salt marshes could affect ecological processes and functioning through affecting crab burrows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","DEC",2009

Although there is currently a great deal of interest in this type of BMP as a means of reducing nutrient and sediment export from disturbed catchments, little is known of its pollutant reduction capabilities and whether there are unintended ecological consequences associated with these structures. For example, dense accumulations of flocculate from iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) have been observed at numerous RSC sites, yet it is unknown whether this flocculate is predominately natural, a consequence of leached iron (Fe) from the materials used in the RSC construction, or because of mobilized Fe from catchment soils influenced by higher groundwater levels that may occur after construction. We analyzed Fe and other solute concentrations in groundwater and perennial streams at RSC and control sites located in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic provinces of MD and DC, and conducted leaching experiments using RSC soils and construction materials. Iron flocculate from FeOB in RSCs is commonly localized and depends on several factors including a source of reduced Fe, the availability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and specific hydrological (i.e., low flow) and physical (i.e., warmer temperatures) conditions. Sources of reduced Fe are derived from both construction materials and catchment soils, which leach Fe in the presence of DOC originating from natural organic matter (OM) deposits and OM incorporated into the RSCs (i.e., wood chips, leaves, logs). Using construction materials that have relatively low Fe content in areas strongly influenced by OM will likely decrease the spatial and temporal presence of dense mats of Fe flocculate thereby improving stream habitat.

Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants' ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations.

Such efforts can help meet many related goals, including habitat creation, ecosystem service provisioning, assisted migration, and the reintroduction of imperiled species following local extirpation. The outcomes of reintroduction efforts, however, are highly variable, with results ranging from local extinction to dramatic population growth; reasons for this variation remain unclear. Here, we ask whether population growth following plant reintroductions is governed by variation at two scales: the scale of individual habitat patches to which individuals are reintroduced, and larger among-landscape scales in which similar patches may be situated in landscapes that differ in matrix type, soil conditions, and other factors. Quantifying demographic variation at these two scales will help prioritize locations for introduction and, once introductions take place, forecast population growth. This work took place within a large-scale habitat fragmentation experiment, where individuals of two perennial forb species were reintroduced into eight replicate similar to 50-ha landscapes, each containing a set of five similar to 1-ha patches that varied in their degree of isolation (connected by habitat corridors or unconnected) and edge-to-area ratio. Using data on individual growth, survival, reproductive output, and recruitment collected one to two years after reintroduction, we developed models to forecast population growth, then compared forecasts to observed population sizes, three and six years later. Both the type of patch (connected and unconnected) and identity of the landscape to which individuals were reintroduced had effects on forecasted population growth rates, but only variation associated with landscape identity was an accurate predictor of subsequently observed population growth rates. Models that did not include landscape identity had minimal forecasting ability, revealing the key importance of variation at this scale for accurate prediction. Of the five demographic rates used to model population dynamics, seed production was the most important source of forecast error in population growth rates. Our results point to the importance of accounting for landscape-scale variation in demographic models and demonstrate how such models might assist with prioritizing particular landscapes for species reintroduction projects.","MAR",2019

These 11 biotic variables were 15-48% higher under shrubs than under grass; multifunction-index was also higher (by 366%). After accounting for spatial autocorrelation and background differences in physico-chemical covariates (redundancy analysis), altered ecosystem functions were attributable to shrubs. Overall, shrubs can enhance ecosystem functions, and maintain important ecological processes through concomitant changes in soil physico-chemical properties. While shrubs should not be equated to ecological degradation, they present a challenging triage of ecosystem service, disservice, and function for grasslands. Management strategies could benefit from targeting patterns of nutrient redistribution under shrubs.","AUG",2018

Permanent settlements lead to the concentration of disturbances (e.g., forest extraction and hunting) and threaten vulnerable species as well as those that provide important ecosystem services such as dung beetles. Here we evaluated the abundance, taxonomic, and functional structure (composition and diversity) of an ecological indicator group-dung beetles-along a disturbance gradient associated with a permanent settlement of the Joti people in the Amazonian region of Venezuela. We applied generalized linear model to assess the response of dung beetle abundance to settlement distance and latent variable model to assess the influence of settlement distance on taxonomic diversity and functional structure. We found the abundance of roller-species increased but small-bodied beetles decreased away from the settlement. We found that proximity to the Joti settlement did not affect metrics of taxonomic and functional diversity of the dung beetle assemblages in general, although functional evenness was lower away from the settlement. In contrast, we found impacts on the functional composition of dung beetles, with significant increase in the community-weighted means for roller species and large-bodied dung beetles away from Joti settlement. Our findings suggest that the transition from nomadism to a more sedentary lifestyle has not caused widespread collapse in the diversity of dung beetle assemblages surrounding the settlement, however significant trends were observed in species-specific responses to human impact, and these responses were mediated by functional traits.",NA,NA

Understanding the relationship between ESs and HWB is important for relevant policy development. Within this context, the purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between ESs and HWB in the social-ecological landscapes of Lefke Region located in North Cyprus. Objectives The objectives of the study include: to assess the relative values of ESs, their contributions to HWB, the relationship between ESs and HWB, and the major drivers of change. Methods The method of the study comprises two parts: (i) to develop a conceptual framework for assessing the linkages between ESs and HWB and (ii) to apply a socio-cultural preference method for evaluating the relative values of ESs and HWB based on local people's perception obtained from a questionnaire. The average relative values were estimated by using a 0-5-point Likert scale. Results The results of the assessment revealed that the respondents perceived 20 ESs with a medium average relative value in all categories of ESs. These services contribute to 11 components of HWB from the highest (security) to the lowest (existence) degree. The relationship between the ESs and HWB changes from medium to low level in relation to several factors (e.g. culture). Several drivers (e.g. urbanization) have caused changes in the ecosystems and flow of ESs. Conclusion The results of this study can contribute to better understanding the human-environment interaction and developing appropriate policies for sustaining ESs and their contributions to HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.","APR",2017

At the Tri-State Milling District, efforts have been made to remediate sites to mitigate the detrimental effects that contamination has caused on human health. While the remediation effort has returned the site to within federal safety standards, it is unclear if this effort is sufficient to restore floral and faunal communities. Intrinsic to ecosystem and organism health is the biodiversity and composition of microbial communities. We have taken advantage of recent advances in sequencing technology and surveyed the bacterial community of remediated and reference soils as well as the intestinal microbial community of two ubiquitous rodent species to provide insight on the impacts of residual heavy metal contamination on the ecosystem. Rodents found on the remediated site had reduced body mass, smaller body size and lower body fat than animals on reference sites. Using barcoded, massively parallel sequencing, we found that bacterial communities in both the soil and Peromyscus spp. gastrointestinal tracts had no difference in diversity between reference and remediated sites but assemblages differed in response to contamination. These results suggest that niche voids left by microbial taxa that were unable to deal with the remnant levels of heavy metals on remediated sites were replaced by taxa that could persist in this environment. Whether this replacement provided similar ecosystem services as ancestral bacterial communities is unknown.","MAR",2010

There are many examples in the literature on how the invasive plants affect the natural environment. Beside reports on negative effects of these invasions, there are also several studies indicating a positive impact of the invaders. Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) is one of the most invasive plant species all over Europe. Earlier studies showed that the goldenrod affects natural plant communities and has a negative impact on many animals, both vertebrates and arthropods. However, all the studies were conducted during goldenrod flowering. In contrast, this study has tested the novel hypothesis that Canadian goldenrod has a positive effect on native spider hunting success and increases spider abundance in farmland outside the growing season. Observations were made during spring on 13 meadows: 7 invaded and 6 non-invaded by goldenrod. All tall plants from experimental plots (1 m(2) each) were examined for the presence of spiders, their nets and prey. Prey items were counted only in spider webs. The results support the hypothesis that S. canadensis is a favourable foraging habitat for spiders: 14.6 spiders/m(2) on invaded plots versus 2.2 on non-invaded ones. Many spiders of the families Theridiidae and Araneidae were found on goldenrod plants, but on native plants only the Araneidae were found. Moreover, on invaded plots, much more prey items/m(2) were present in spiders webs than on non-invaded plots (155.3 vs. 13.8). The study is a rare example of a positive influence of invasive plants on the native arthropod community. This is also a novel approach that shows the importance of dry goldenrod stems in invaded ecosystems.","OCT",2016

However, no study has assessed thoroughly how interactions between these factors alter ecosystem functions and multifunctionality of green roofs. We simulated some green roof conditions in a pot experiment. We planted 20 plant species from 10 genera and five families (Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Crassulaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae) on two substrate types (natural vs. artificial) and two substrate depths (10 cm vs. 30 cm). As indicators of major ecosystem functions, we measured aboveground and belowground biomasses, foliar nitrogen and carbon content, foliar transpiration, substrate water retention, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrates in leachates. Interactions between substrate type and depth strongly affected ecosystem functions. Biomass production was increased in the artificial substrate and deeper substrates, as was water retention in most cases. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon leaching was higher in the artificial substrates. Except for the Fabaceae species, nitrate leaching was reduced in deep, natural soils. The highest transpiration rates were associated with natural soils. All functions were modulated by plant families or species. Plant effects differed according to the observed function and the type and depth of the substrate. Fabaceae species grown on natural soils had the most noticeable patterns, allowing high biomass production and high water retention but also high nitrate leaching from deep pots. No single combination of factors enhanced simultaneously all studied ecosystem functions, highlighting that soil-plant interactions induce trade-offs between ecosystem functions.

Moreover, in agricultural landscapes, local agroecosystem management can support biodiversity maintenance and pest control by adding resources in less complex landscapes with fewer resources. However, we lack an understanding of how local and landscape factors interact to affect natural enemy communities and their site fidelity to agroecosystems in urban landscapes (i.e., cityscapes). To better understand how local and landscape factors influence natural enemies in urban agroecosystems, we used urban community gardens as a model system to test if and how local resource manipulation and differences in cityscape quality affect natural enemy (ladybird beetles, parasitoid wasps) communities and their fidelity to urban habitats. We performed two manipulations. First, we added local floral resources in 6 of 12 gardens situated in different cityscapes to measure differences in natural enemy biodiversity. Second, in those 12 gardens, with and without resource additions, we manipulated populations of a common natural enemy, Hippodamia convergens, to assess fidelity to the gardens. Floral resource additions increased parasitoid abundance and changed community composition, but had little effect on ladybeetle abundance, richness or site fidelity. Rather, ladybeetle fidelity to gardens was lower in gardens in low quality cityscapes with high impervious cover. Cityscape quality influences natural enemies in and fidelity to gardens. Landscape-moderated biodiversity patterns observed in rural landscapes likely differ from urban contexts with implications for pest control.","JUN",2018

Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosystems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking. 2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroecosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosystem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices. 3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunctionality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services ( marginal R-2 = 0.05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R-2 = 0.15-0.38). 4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycultures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.","APR",2017

Estimates of the ecosystem services provided by the restoration project are used to justify, prioritize, and evaluate such projects. However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under-represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel Ischadium recurvum can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. We measured the temperature-dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2-fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5-3 mu m), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100% of phytoplankton during the summer months.","JUL",2014

Carbon and biodiversity can be enhanced by integrating natural habitats into agricultural lands, but a key question is whether benefits are maximized by including many small features throughout the landscape ('land-sharing' agriculture) or a few large contiguous blocks alongside intensive farmland ('land-sparing' agriculture). In this study, we are the first to integrate carbon storage alongside multi-taxa biodiversity assessments to compare land-sparing and land-sharing frameworks. We do so by sampling carbon stocks and biodiversity (birds and dung beetles) in landscapes containing agriculture and forest within the Colombian Choco-Andes, a zone of high global conservation priority. We show that woodland fragments embedded within a matrix of cattle pasture hold less carbon per unit area than contiguous primary or advanced secondary forests (>15 years). Farmland sites also support less diverse bird and dung beetle communities than contiguous forests, even when farmland retains high levels of woodland habitat cover. Landscape simulations based on these data suggest that land-sparing strategies would be more beneficial for both carbon storage and biodiversity than land-sharing strategies across a range of production levels. Biodiversity benefits of land-sparing are predicted to be similar whether spared lands protect primary or advanced secondary forests, owing to the close similarity of bird and dung beetle communities between the two forest classes. Land-sparing schemes that encourage the protection and regeneration of natural forest blocks thus provide a synergy between carbon and biodiversity conservation, and represent a promising strategy for reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on tropical ecosystems. However, further studies examining a wider range of ecosystem services will be necessary to fully understand the links between land-allocation strategies and long-term ecosystem service provision.","JUL",2014

A methodology is proposed to investigate associations between socioeconomic indicators and structural variables of the urban forest, and also which structural variables of the urban forest, if any, differ along a socioeconomic gradient. Our results reveal that before setting planning and management goals, it is crucial to understand local patterns of ES and their relationships with socioeconomic patterns, which can be affected by variables such as building age. This should be followed by the identification of structural variables of the urban forest that better explain the differences, in order to target these through planning and management goals.

To test this, we assessed the relative importance of tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in young forest plantations tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging.","DEC",2015

We applied it to two large Baltic lagoons, the Szczecin and the Curonian Lagoons demonstrating a quantitative and qualitative assessment approach. Firstly, an initial status is defined reflecting, according to the European Water Framework Directive, a past situation when the ecosystems where in a so called good ecological state. In both Baltic lagoons, this refers to a situation around 1960. Secondly, a present state is defined, assessed and compared to the initial status. Increasing anthropogenic impacts in Szczecin Lagoon caused an overall decrease ecological status which may influence the system's ability to provide services. Assessing ES changes semi-quantitatively via 39 indicators and 22 services, we show a decrease in provisioning and regulating and maintenance and an increase of cultural services' provision. According to 15 expert valuations, the Curonian Lagoon displays no changes in provisioning but an increase in regulating and maintenance and cultural service provision. We discuss how these results can serve different marine management approaches and support different polices.

C.; Per, Esra; Norton, Briony A.; Gaston, Kevin J.","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","Recent research has demonstrated how scavenging, the act of consuming dead animals, plays a key role in ecosystem structure, functioning, and stability. A growing number of studies suggest that vertebrate scavengers also provide key ecosystem services, the benefits humans gain from the natural world, particularly in the removal of carcasses from the environment. An increasing proportion of the human population is now residing in cities and towns, many of which, despite being highly altered environments, contain significant wildlife populations, and so animal carcasses. Indeed, non-predation fatalities may be higher within urban than natural environments. Despite this, the fate of carcasses in urban environments and the role vertebrate scavengers play in their removal have not been determined. In this study, we quantify the role of vertebrate scavengers in urban environments in three towns in the UK. Using experimentally deployed rat carcasses and rapid fire motion-triggered cameras, we determined which species were scavenging and how removal of carcass biomass was partitioned between them. Of the 63 experimental carcasses deployed, vertebrate scavenger activity was detected at 67%. There was a significantly greater depletion in carcass biomass in the presence (mean loss of 194 g) than absence (mean loss of 14 g) of scavengers. Scavenger activity was restricted to three species, Carrion crows Corvus corone, Eurasian magpies Pica pica, and European red foxes Vulpes vulpes. From behavioral analysis, we estimated that a maximum of 73% of the carcass biomass was removed by vertebrate scavengers. Despite having low species richness, the urban scavenger community in our urban study system removed a similar proportion of carcasses to those reported in more pristine environments. Vertebrate scavengers are providing a key urban ecosystem service in terms of carcass removal. This service is, however, often overlooked, and the species that provide it are among some of the most disliked and persecuted.","OCT",2016

Ecosystem production of freshwater varies with precipitation and evapotranspiration rates, which are affected by climate, topography, vegetation cover, and soil characteristics. Urban demand for freshwater is spatially distributed due to the location of cities, the variation in the per-capita usage, and the variation in urban population size. To link the spatially heterogeneous patterns of cities and ecosystem service production rates we calculated heterogeneous ecological footprints (HEF) of the land area required to provide urban freshwater needs. We asked, what determines urban freshwater footprint area in cities of the United States and China? Are the same factors operating in the same fashion in both countries? Our results show the strong interaction between population size and local resource production in determining footprint. These results suggest extending the I=PAT identity to include a term describing local ecosystem service productivity in the determination of human impact.

When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species population change.","JUL",2008

Currently, carbon is of particular interest as policies for increasing carbon storage on federal lands are being proposed. However, a challenge in joint production analysis of forest management is adequately representing ecological conditions and processes that influence joint production relationships. We used simulation models of vegetation structure, forest sector carbon, and potential wildlife habitat to characterize landscape-level joint production possibilities for carbon storage, timber harvest, and habitat for seven wildlife species across a range of forest management regimes. We sought to (1) characterize the general relationships of production possibilities for combinations of carbon storage, timber, and habitat, and (2) identify management variables that most influence joint production relationships. Our 160 000-ha study landscape featured environmental conditions typical of forests in the Western Cascade Mountains of Oregon (USA). Our results indicate that managing forests for carbon storage involves trade-offs among timber harvest and habitat for focal wildlife species, depending on the disturbance interval and utilization intensity followed. Joint production possibilities for wildlife species varied in shape, ranging from competitive to complementary to compound, reflecting niche breadth and habitat component needs of species examined. Managing Pacific Northwest forests to store forest sector carbon can be roughly complementary with habitat for Northern Spotted Owl, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and red tree vole. However, managing forests to increase carbon storage potentially can be competitive with timber production and habitat for Pacific marten, Pileated Woodpecker, and Western Bluebird, depending on the disturbance interval and harvest intensity chosen. Our analysis suggests that joint production possibilities under forest management regimes currently typical on industrial forest lands (e.g., 40- to 80-yr rotations with some tree retention for wildlife) represent but a small fraction of joint production outcomes possible in the region. Although the theoretical boundaries of the production possibilities sets we developed are probably unachievable in the current management environment, they arguably define the long-term potential of managing forests to produce multiple ecosystem services within and across multiple forest ownerships.","OCT",2016

Maintaining semi-wild, perennial habitat fragments as refugia to support parasitoids can increase biodiversity and provide ecosystem services in annual and short-cycle crop fields. Our results indicated that crop pests escaped parasitism by two important tachinid species in landscapes with greater than 38% and 51% cover of annual cropland, respectively. Landscape-level research is critical for integrating science and policy to conserve biodiversity, promote sustainable agroecosystems and evaluate new anti-wildlife vegetation removal campaigns that may harm biological control agents while targeting microbial food contamination.","DEC",2012

Resilience, an ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic services to changing mowing regimes? Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park. Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness, Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models. Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P. paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows, this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves. Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely applicable to different types of restoration or management interventions, across regions and biota.","OCT",2018

J.; Fabricius, Christo","ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY","Designing broad-scale conservation corridors has become increasingly common as a way of conducting an assessment for achieving targets for the representation and persistence of nature. However, since many of these corridors must traverse agricultural and other production landscapes, planning and implementation are not trivial tasks. Most approaches to conservation assessments in the dynamic world of production landscapes are data-intensive and analytically complex. However, in the real world, donor and other external requirements impose time and budget constraints, and dictate strong stakeholder involvement in the entire planning process. In order to accommodate this, assessments must be rapid, cheap, and the approach and products must be comprehensible and acceptable to stakeholders. Here we describe such an assessment aimed at identifying and implementing a network of conservation corridors in the Gouritz Initiative project domain of South Africa's Cape Floristic Region hotspot. We used empirical data and expert knowledge to identify a corridor network hypothesized to sustain key ecological and evolutionary processes. We also consulted experts to provide a spatially explicit assessment of the opportunity costs of conservation associated with agriculture, the predominant land use in the region. We used these products to identify categories of land requiring different actions and instruments to achieve conservation goals, thereby moving from the ""where"" to the ""how"" of conservation. This information was then fed into the collaborative strategy development process for the Gouritz Initiative. Our discussion emphasizes the lessons that we learnt from undertaking this assessment, particularly lessons regarding the implementation of the planning products. We conclude that at the outset of any planning project, a consensus on the vision must be achieved, a detailed social assessment of appropriate institutions must be undertaken, and a learning organization that practices adaptive comanagement should be established. These institutional and governance requirements are fundamental to successful implementation of conservation-planning products.",NA,2010

A third factor was also included, testing whether different cultivars responded differently to the tested factors. Insect pollination was required to reach high yield and seed quality (oil content). Final benefits of pollination service were, however, greatly modified by cultivar, where the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar largely depended on insect pollination whereas the two hybrid cultivars did not. A near significant interaction between nitrogen input and insect pollination was also found, i.e. benefits to crop yield from insect pollination seemed to increase with decreased nitrogen levels. The differential response of the three cultivars suggested opportunities to use cultivars that are less dependent on insect pollination in landscapes where this service has been deteriorated. Increased access of nitrogen seems to partly compensate yield losses from poor insect pollination.

We tested whether native and exotic grasslands differ in species diversity, ecosystem services, and an important aspect of functional diversity (C-3:C-4 proportions) by sampling 42 sites along a latitudinal gradient and conducting a controlled experiment. Exotic-dominated grasslands had drastically lower plant diversity and slightly higher tissue N concentrations and forage quality compared to native-dominated sites. Exotic sites were strongly dominated by C-4 species at southern and C-3 species at northern latitudes with a sharp transition at 36-38A degrees, whereas native sites contained C-3:C-4 mixtures. Large differences in C-3:C-4 proportions and temporal niche partitioning were found between native and exotic mixtures in the experiment, implying that differences in C-3:C-4 proportions along the latitudinal gradient are caused partially by species themselves. Our results indicate that the replacement of native- by exotic-dominated grasslands has created a management tradeoff (high diversity versus high levels of certain ecosystem services) and that models of global change impacts and C-3/C-4 distribution should consider effects of exotic species.","JUN",2014

This can result in an inefficient IAS management. We address this issue by describing the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) that enables expert elicitation for rapidly assessing the ecological consequences of IAS using the ecosystem services (ES) framework. INSEAT scores the ecosystem service ""gains and losses"" using a scale that accounted for the magnitude and the reversibility of its effects. We tested INSEAT on 18 IAS in Great Britain. Here, we highlighted four case studies: Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin ladybird), Astacus leptodactylus (Turkish crayfish), Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). The results demonstrated that a collation of different experts' opinions using INSEAT could yield valuable information on the invasive aliens' ecological and social effects. The users can identify certain IAS as ES providers and the trade-offs between the ES provision and loss associated with them.

Delivery of particular services relies on specific ecological functions, and thus to varying degree on wetland ecological condition, commonly quantified as departure from minimally impacted reference sites. Condition assessments are widely adopted as regulatory indicators of ecosystem function, and for some services (e.g., habitat) links between condition and function are often direct. For others, however, links are more tenuous, and using condition alone to enumerate ecosystem value (e.g., for compensatory mitigation) may underestimate important services. Hydrologic function affects many services cited in support of wetland protection both directly (floodwater retention, microclimate regulation) and indirectly (biogeochemical cycling, pollutant removal). We investigated links between condition and hydrologic function to test the hypothesis, embedded in regulatory assessment of wetland value, that condition predicts function. Condition was assessed using rapid and intensive approaches, including Florida's official wetland assessment tool, in 11 isolated forested wetlands in north Florida (USA) spanning a land use intensity gradient. Hydrologic function was assessed using hydrologic regime (mean, variance, and rates of change of water depth), and measurements of groundwater exchange and evapotranspiration (ET). Despite a wide range in condition, no systematic variation in hydrologic regime was observed; indeed reference sites spanned the full range of variation. In contrast, ET was affected by land use, with higher rates in intensive (agriculture and urban) landscapes in response to higher leaf area. ET determines latent heat exchange, which regulates microclimate, a valuable service in urban heat islands. Higher ET also indicates higher productivity and thus carbon cycling. Groundwater exchange regularly reversed flow direction at all sites in response to rainfall. This buffering effect on regional aquifer levels, an underappreciated service of isolated wetlands, was provided regardless of condition. Intensive landscapes may benefit most from the hydrologic services that wetlands provide because that is where certain services (floodwater storage, microclimate regulation) are realized. While the portfolio of wetland services clearly changes with disturbance, our results support a revised approach to wetland valuation that recognizes the services that accrue from sustained or enhanced functions in these working wetlands.","OCT",2013

Here, we used a trait-based approach in combination with a newly developed application of principal response curves to functionally characterize a rapid taxonomic shift in the eastern English Channel fish community in the late 1990s. We identified the functional groups with the greatest contributions to the overall shift in fish functional structure and uncovered significant trait-environment relationships. We found that pelagic species with rapid life history cycles, characterized by broadcast spawning, small offspring size, and early maturation, declined considerably in abundance following an increase in sea surface temperature associated with a warming phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which was likely exacerbated by historical fishing pressure. In contrast, species with late maturation, high parental care, and few, well-developed offspring increased in abundance, reinforcing that fish community responses to climate warming are strongly mediated through life history traits. By examining how environmental factors drove a community shift at the trait level, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how fish functional structure responds to rapid environmental change.","43784",2018

The ecological importance of spatially connected habitats to conservation is well established for terrestrial environments. However, few studies have applied spatial metrics, including measures of structural connectivity to marine environments. We examined the relationship between catch-per-unit- effort for commercially caught species and the spatial patterning of mapped benthic habitat types along the coast of Queensland, Australia in their dominant fisheries (trawl, line, net or pot fisheries). We quantified the composition and spatial configuration of seascapes and calculated coastline length, number of estuaries, river length and geographical latitude using 12 metrics within ninety 30-nautical-mile grid cells, which supported inshore fish catch data from 21 species groups. Multiple regression analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots indicated that ecological linkages may exist between geo-morphic coastal features and nearshore fisheries production for a number of species groups. Connectivity indices for mangroves, salt marsh and channels explained the largest proportion (30-70%), suggesting the importance of connected tidal wetlands for fisheries. Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) catch-per-unit-effort was best explained by the number of wetland patches, mangrove connectivity and wetland connectivity (r(2) = 0.38, n = 28). Catch-per-unit- effort for the Gulf of Carpentaria was highly correlated with wetland connectivity, the number of estuaries and seagrass patch density (r = 037, n = 29). The findings could guide the spatial design of marine protected area networks to maintain ecosystem services and avoid potential disruption to connectivity caused by habitat removal or modification. Application of the same approach to analyses of finer spatial scales would enable catch information to be related to particular estuarine habitats and provide better understanding of the importance of habitat connectivity for fisheries.

This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.",NA,2015

This type of analysis of interacting sub-systems requires an advanced model integration platform, yet open for learning and for further development. Moreover, since the aim is to increase urban experience with ecosystem management in the wide sense, the platform needs to be open and easily available, with high visualisation capacity. For this purpose, the LEAM model was applied to the Stockholm Region and two potential future scenarios were developed, resulting from alternative policies. The scenarios differed widely and the dense urban development of Scenario Compact could be visualised, destroying much of the Greenstructure of Stockholm, while Scenario Urban Nature steered the development more to outer suburbs and some sprawl. For demonstration of the need for further development of biodiversity assessment models, a network model tied to a prioritised ecological profile was applied and altered by the scenarios. It could be shown that the Greenstructure did not support this profile very well. Thus, there is a need for dynamic models for negotiations, finding alternative solutions and interacting with other models.

Tree diversity effects on attack rate were driven by complementarity among tree species, with increases in attack rate observed on all tree species in polycultures.

Resilient and functional landscapes are essential for climate change adaptation. Thermodynamic theory has been applied increasingly to ecological studies to understand ecosystem resilience and integrity. Resilient ecosystems have complex structure and greater levels of biomass and functional diversity, which act to enhance the degradation of solar energy. Forests that exhibit these characteristics express thermodynamic efficiency through a greater capacitance effect that promotes cooler surface temperatures under extreme weather conditions. 2. With forest disturbance, complex structures and functional linkages are simplified, reducing the capacity of the system to degrade energy. Such changes can lead to dysfunctional ecosystem states, impaired provision of ecosystem services and a weakened resilience. 3. This study has applied indicators based on thermodynamic theory to a chronosequence of forest ecosystems in the UK, Germany and Ukraine. Surface temperatures were measured to test thermodynamic theories relating to energy degradation and temperature moderation. Grimes CSR model was applied to plant data to compare functional complexity in vegetation between stands. 4. Old-growth woodlands are shown to attenuate surface temperature more effectively than native species plantations. Consistently lower temperatures were observed in European old-growth forests with high proportions of biomass when compared to managed stands of similar species composition, suggesting a greater efficiency of energy degradation in complex forest ecosystems, particularly at higher temperatures. 5. Analysis of plant species data using Grimes CSR model indicated that old-growth forests ordinate towards competitive and stress-tolerant communities in contrast to intensively managed forests, which had a greater proportion of generalist and ruderal species. High CSR functional scores were associated with moderated temperature extremes. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest an important thermodynamic basis for conservation in the context of climate change. Conservation practice and management policy, which is based on preserving ecosystem complexity and function, can aid in mitigating the effects of extreme temperatures, enhancing vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and water retention. Old-growth forests have a significant climate mitigation role alongside other recognised ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.","JUN",2012

One of these functions, regulation of herbivorous insects by predators, shapes tropical communities through cascading trophic effects. An improved understanding of how predation pressure on herbivorous insects varies with reforestation strategy, management decisions, and landscape context would guide restoration practice. We measured predation pressure by birds and arthropods on dummy caterpillars in five forest types in Panama. These land covers represent natural and managed forest conditions: non-native monoculture plantation, native multispecies plantation, young natural forest succession, secondary gallery forest, and old-growth forest. We also placed dummy caterpillars in residential countryside, a heavily disturbed nonforest land cover. In three land covers, we surveyed bird communities to examine the relationship between predator abundance and predation pressure. Predation pressure from birds was lowest in the intensively managed plantations and highest in land covers with structurally complex vegetation: successional forest, gallery forest, and residential countryside. In the non-native plantation, bird predation increased with proximity to gallery forest. We found strong correspondence between bird abundance and bird attacks on dummy caterpillars. Arthropod predation pressure was highest in the native plantation but, unlike bird predation pressure, did not vary strongly by land cover. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions by insectivorous birds can be enhanced on reforestation lands by incorporating unmanaged areas and tolerating nonplanted understory vegetation. We recommend that, regardless of management objectives, forest managers adopt a holistic approach to reforestation to facilitate recovery of animal-dependent ecosystem functions.","NOV",2018

To broaden the strategies to address this issue, many cities are now embracing ecosystem-based adaptation and resilience. But, in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the approach is yet to make much headway. This paper examines how climate change impacts on poor urban people via one component of urban ecosystem - urban green structures (UGS) - in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It examines: the UGS of importance to the city's informal dwellers and the range of derived services; changes over time to these UGS and derived services; and emerging adaptation practices. Using qualitative methods, the study has three key findings. First, cultural ecosystem services are of greatest importance to informal dwellers, although they do harness a range of other services. Second, the city's UGS have undergone dramatic changes due to both climatic and non-climatic factors. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the quantity and quality of UGS-derived services for the urban poor. Third, in responding to these changes, informal settlement dwellers have relied mostly on their personal, and sometimes on their collective, resources and capabilities. There are some innovative practices that draw on external institutions, but access to external support for informal communities has remained consistently low. City authorities should approach and plan greening 'for' (not 'in') informal settlements as a targeted environmental improvement endeavour - referred to here as 'creative urban planning'.","DEC",2018

We measured plant productivity, plant nutrient stoichiometry, and concentrations of N, P, and K in shoots and roots of Phragmites australis and Rumex maritimus and monitored how the clay-rich sediment from lake Markermeer changed into a wetland soil. Plants grown on Markermeer sediments tend to be N limited when periodically inundated and P limited when not inundated at all. The P availability was determined by the hydrological regime, while the N availability was determined by both the hydrological regime and the sediment type.

These plants continue to provide multiple goods and services, such as fodder, fuelwood, medicines, fruits, shade and aesthetic appeal. However, as they invade negative impacts arise. This often leads to conflicts of interests and trade-offs between the benefits and costs of these species and, ultimately, the environment and local livelihoods. Traditionally, invasive plant species research in dryland systems has tended to focus on the impacts of these species on large-scale natural systems, primarily rangelands and river courses. Limited work has been undertaken regarding the role of these species in providing services and disservices within homesteads and settlements in these harsh environments. Such knowledge is important with regards to management. The primary aim of this study was therefore to assess the assimilation of invasive plant species into the lives of households in several small farming settlements in the arid Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. Specific objectives were to: 1) assess the diversity, prevalence and size structure of invasive plants in resident's homesteads; 2) identify sources, local practices, knowledge and beliefs related to the invasive plants present as well as local management practices; and 3) understand residents' perceptions of the ecosystem services and disservices these species deliver. To do this, we used household and 'drive-past' surveys, in-depth interviews and measurement of plants in homesteads. From the 'drive-past' survey, we identified 12 officially listed and one proposed invasive plant species in the settlements, 10 of which were covered in the household survey. Eight native tree species were also present, but these were at much lower frequency and density than introduced species. Thirteen different goods and services from the invasive plants were recognised with the most common being shade, aesthetics and fuelwood. Some species, such as Morus alba and Opuntia ficus-indica, were important for fruit, while eight species were mentioned as being used for fodder. Respondents also mentioned that O. ficus-indica, Prosopis spp., Leucaena leucocephala and Melia azedarach imposed costs. These disservices included reductions in water supply, damage to buildings and human health impacts. Some of these species were also perceived to be spreading beyond homesteads in some settlements and invading rangeland. Less than a quarter of households had no invasive plants in their yards, and these were mainly new dwellings in the growing informal areas around the settlements. Invasive plants were obtained from variety of sources suggesting various pathways of introduction. We conclude by discussing some options for management focusing on Prosopis, as the invasive plant perceived to most rapidly expanding and generating the most disservices. We also highlight what further research is needed with regard to filling research gaps on invasive plant species within social-ecological systems in arid areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that, given the rapid decrease in children's daily contact with nature, public appreciation of the value of the natural world is likely gradually also to decrease. This can be a major obstacle to reversing global environmental challenges. People should therefore be encouraged to experience neighbourhood natural environments and biodiversity, and city planners and policy makers will play a vital role in connecting people with nature.

We examined changes in land cover and riparian tree canopy near Sacramento, California, a Mediterranean climate region impacted by agriculture before urbanization. We used aerial imagery to quantify changes in land cover and the area, width, and density of riparian tree canopy between 1937 and 2014 for the 85-km(2) Arcade Creek watershed. While watershed land cover shifted almost entirely from pasture and crops to urban development, riparian forested area increased by 38 percent. The median width of riparian tree canopy more than doubled, and the density along smaller streams increased significantly (p < 0.0001). We used multiple data sources to examine potential drivers of these changes. Stream gage data and field observations indicated that the formerly intermittent Arcade Creek stream network receives spatially and temporally variable dry-season flow subsidies from urban runoff, but widespread channel incision may limit the impact of subsidies on riparian vegetation. Accordingly, sampling of riparian woody plants showed few hydrophilic species growing along these streams. Instead we found evidence of native oak regeneration and a high density of escaped horticultural species. The increase in riparian forest cover was thus likely due to changes in vegetation management and species composition from land use conversion, possibly augmented by increased dry-season water availability. The changes in canopy cover we quantified stand in contrast to the accepted pattern of riparian forest decline with urbanization, and are expected to affect ecosystem services.","APR",2018

Urbanization is a growing stressor due the 2.5 billion additional people projected to live in urban areas by 2050. Potential climate change impacts to natural systems increase the need for sustainable urbanization, which should integrate land use needs for urban growth with climate adaptation objectives such as maintaining biodiversity, food production and ecosystem services. Here we compare climate-neutral and climate-adaptive urbanization scenarios to see which produces the most sustainable urbanization, defined as being the most effective at meeting development, conservation, and two climate adaptation objectives. We modeled five urban growth scenarios portraying an increase of 25.8 million people by 2050 for California, USA comprising three climate-neutral scenarios: business-as-usual, compact-new-growth and infill (redevelopment); and two climate-adaptive scenarios: preservation of agricultural climate refugia or future plant dispersal corridors. Infill was the least impacting for the multiple objectives tested; preserving 46-57% more land for other uses. Each climate-adaptive scenario reduced land consumption for its respective target, but increased impacts to the opposite climate-adaptive scenario target. Infill has the potential to contribute towards sustainable urbanization, particularly if combined with other climate adaptation targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","JAN",2017

The degree of aquatic ecosystem naturalness, or ecological status as it is defined in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union, is notionally linked to supplies of ecosystem services. In practice, these links have rarely been documented or even investigated, and to justify conservation and management objectives based on the status indicators, it is essential to demonstrate their relationships to ecosystem functions and services. The WFD requires member states to classify their surface waters aiming to achieve good ecological status of water bodies. However, an implicit assumption of the WFD, that the ecosystem functions and services targeted to be protected and maintained are related to the measured status, remains uncertain. Using a time-series data set covering almost 50years, we examined the development of ecological status of eight sub-basins of a large boreal lake in response to improved wastewater management and decreasing pollution. We particularly evaluated whether the observed descriptors of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services were associated with the judgements of ecological status, and hence whether the ecological status is a relevant proxy for ecosystem values to be protected. The ecological status of the polluted sub-basins responded consistently to the decreased nutrient and organic loading. Temporal trends in the biological quality elements and water quality were mostly parallel and showed good status roughly simultaneously. Combined ecological status also appeared to predict some features of taxon diversity (profundal macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton richness), ecosystem functions (primary and bacterial production) and ecosystem services (fish catch and reproductive potential of coregonids). Synthesis and applications. We observed that some ecosystem service supplies and taxon diversity increased with increasing ecological status of the lake. Therefore, our results suggest that ecological status estimates based on simple structural characters are relevant to the ultimate management goals of maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services and hence might suffice for extensive assessment and monitoring of lake ecosystems.","JUN",2014

We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64-91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54-77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions.

The global biodiversity hotspot of north-eastern Madagascar exemplifies these challenges. Combining land use data obtained through remote sensing with social-ecological data from a regional level household survey, we attempt to make the links between land use and ecosystem service benefits explicit. Our study confirmed that remotely sensed information on landscapes reflects households' involvement in rice production systems. We further characterized landscapes in terms of ""ecosystem service bundles"" linked to specific land uses, as well as in terms of ecosystem service benefits to households.

We found drastic decreases in bumble-bee community evenness, with potential consequences for level and stability of red clover seed yield. The relative abundances of two short-tongued bumble-bees have increased from 40 per cent in the 1940s to entirely dominate present communities with 89 per cent. Average seed yield declined in recent years and variation in yield doubled, suggesting that the current dependence on few species for pollination has been especially detrimental to stability in seed yield.

We analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents' knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and uncontrolled extraction.

However, protected areas, especially freshwater, are under threat with overexploitation of resources changing the land covers and degrading their capacity to supply services. Information on land cover changes and its implications on ecosystems, its services and people, especially in developing countries at a local scale, is largely absent. This study, therefore, seeks to understand people's dependency on ecosystem services and implications of land cover change on ecosystem services and people, with a case study in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve of Nepal. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, our findings show high dependency of the locals on a vast array of ecosystem services provided by the reserve. More than half of the sampled households were found to directly derive income from ecosystem services of the reserve. However, land cover changes especially declines in forest (16%), swamps/marshes (4%), rivers (14%) and other ecosystems over a period of 34-years impacted the provision of ecosystem services and people's dependency notably. The services from forests declined by about 94%, swamps services by 36% and services from river by 57% which were reported to be the high service suppliers. People's dependency, as perceived by the locals, was reduced by 67% over the last ten years. The study highlighting the supply, demand and implications on ecosystem services and people helped to better understand the complex interaction between humans and ecosystems. These results can be used to develop holistic approaches to restore, conserve and manage the ecosystems, and its services by balancing equal supply and demand of ecosystem services required for a self-sustaining human environment system.

While rapidly growing in popularity, the ecosystem services approach has been criticized for adopting a homogenous approach to communities and failing to consider social diversity and associated power structures influencing access to benefits. In this paper, we adopt an environmental justice lens to analyse access to ecosystem services in a case study of community forestry in Nepal. Using mixed methods, our disaggregated analysis shows that access to ecosystem services is differentiated by social characteristics such as caste, income and gender with uneven distributive outcomes and participation. High-income groups were able to disproportionately access the benefits despite the social equity provisions built into policy and institutional structures. Our study shows that some of the protections oriented at assisting disadvantaged groups were experienced as onerous and should be amended if they are to have beneficial outcomes. In highlighting entrenched inequities, we argue that the ecosystem services approach needs to make environmental justice more central to avoid further marginalising the marginalized, and have far and just outcomes.

We found that fig species constituted the major portion of the diet of the flying fox (94.6%). When foraging, the flying fox preferred seed figs from female trees over gall figs from male trees in functionally dioecious fig species. Germination experiments showed a significantly higher percentage of germination for fig seeds in feces than those from pellets and ripe figs (feces: 80.2%, pellets: 23.4%, ripe figs: 32.9%). Considering the active selection of seed figs and avoidance of gall figs by foraging flying foxes, we suggest that the abundance of seed figs accurately represents food availability for dioecy. This preference for seed figs or viable seeds can effectively promote the survival of pollinating wasps and might reinforce the evolution of dioecism in figs.

Due to the instrumental value inherent in ES, priority areas for their conservation should be selected based on their capacity to both ensure an available supply and meet beneficiary demands. However, such a methodology has yet to be developed. Aiming to adapt systematic conservation planning procedures to include ES, we conducted a case study in eastern Canada focusing on ten ES for 16 wetland types. We first delimited the ES supply accessible for human use from the total biophysical supply and mapped demand for each ES. Secondly, we assembled conservation networks targeting the accessible supply and demand and compared them with networks targeting either ES biophysical supply or accessible supply. We found that targeting only ES supply resulted in selecting sites that are not in demand and may be up to three times less efficient in fulfilling the demands of beneficiaries for local flow ES. Thus, not considering demand in ES conservation assessment fails to position reserves where ES supply is likely to be most useful. Setting conservation targets for ES supply and demand could therefore help to achieve ES conservation objectives. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.","DEC",2014

Bats deserve attention because they occupy different trophic niches and perform different functions in nature, acting as flower pollinators (nectarivores), seed dispersers (frugivores), and pest controllers (insectivores). The effects of climate change on the distribution of bat species occurring in the Carajas National Forest (Eastern Amazon, southeastern Path state, Brazil) was examined by modeling species distributions. A total of 83 species of bats providing the above mentioned services were analyzed for the years 2050 and 2070 to answer the following two questions: (i) Which species are potentially more sensitive to climate changes and will not be able to find suitable areas in Carajas in the future, and (ii) Which are the priority areas that protect the greatest number of species from climate change. Of the total species analyzed, 47 (57%) will potentially not find suitable areas in Carajas under the scenarios employed. Pollinators, seed dispersers, and more-generalist (omnivorous) bats will potentially be the most affected, suffering a 28-36% decrease in suitable area under the 2070 scenario, which may have implications for the plants with which those species interact. According to the scenarios employed, the Carajas National Forest, as well as other conservation units in Path, will not protect most species in the future. The most suitable areas are located mainly to the north and west of the state and under varying degrees of conservation: from well-preserved protected areas to areas degraded due to different anthropogenic impacts. This study emphasizes that the possible effect of climate change and the location of species protection areas need to be analyzed together to ensure that the areas that will act as potential climate refuges for species in the future are indeed protected.","FEB",2018

Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.",NA,NA

Location: Rottnest Island, Western Australia. Methods: A time series of standardized quantitative surveys of reef fishes spanning 8years of pronounced ocean temperature change is used to test whether accurate predictions on shifts in species occupancy and abundance are possible using species traits. Results: Species-level responses in occurrence and abundance were closely related to the mid-point of their realized thermal niche, more so than body size, range size or trophic level. Most of the species that disappeared from survey counts during the heatwave were characterized by geographic ranges that did not extend to latitudes with temperatures equivalent to the ocean temperature peak during the heatwave. We thus find support for the hypothesis that current distribution limits are set directly or indirectly by temperature and are highly responsive to ocean temperature variability. Main conclusions: Our study shows that reef fish community structure can change very quickly when exposed to extreme thermal anomalies, in directions predicted from the realized thermal niche of the species present. Such predictions can thus identify species that will be most responsive to changing ocean climate. Continued warming, coupled with periodic extreme heat events, may lead to the loss of ecosystem services and ecological functions, as mobile species relocate to more hospitable climes, while less mobile species may head towards extinction.","AUG",2018

Preserving and restoring woodland habitats is critical for recovering this biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. While forest restoration projects typically focus on improving degraded woodlands, fewer studies have investigated the conversion of suburban, lawn-dominated landscapes back into healthy forest ecosystems. In this study, we evaluated different strategies for establishing a forest ecosystem on land that for over 20 years had been maintained as turf grass. Five native, herbaceous woodland plants (Arisaema triphyllum, Carex pensylvanica, Diarrhena americana, Geranium maculatum, and Podophyllum peltatum) were planted around five nurse trees (Acer rubrum, Amelanchier arborea, Cercis canadensis, Tsuga canadensis, and Viburnum opulus var. americanum) in four soil treatments: bare soil; 5 cm of leaf mulch; rototilling and 5 cm of leaf mulch; and 10 cm of leaf mulch. We assessed the prevalence of weeds in each soil treatment two years after planting. We also analyzed survivorship and performance data seven years after planting to evaluate how nurse tree species and soil treatment affect herbaceous species. We found that mulching decreased the prevalence of weedy species and did not affect survivorship or performance of herbaceous transplants. Overall survivorship varied significantly, with P. peltatum having the highest survivorship and C. pensylvanica the lowest. Survivorship was influenced by nurse tree species, and was lowest around T. canadensis. Similar restoration projects should consider using species that were successful in this project, avoid planting near T. canadensis, and consider leaf mulch for weed control.","JUN",2017

These approaches fail to make a distinction between the actual service provision and the underlying ecosystem capacity to provide the service. We present an integrative conceptual framework to estimate the provision of soil erosion prevention by combining the structural impact of soil erosion and the social-ecological processes that allow for its mitigation. The framework was tested and illustrated in the Portel municipality in Southern Portugal, a Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system that is prone to desertification and soil degradation. The results show a clear difference in the spatial and temporal distribution of the capacity for ecosystem service provision and the actual ecosystem service provision. It also shows that although the average actual ecosystem service provision in the region is sufficient to mitigate the existing structural impact, vulnerable areas can be identified where significant soil losses are not mitigated at present. This becomes more significant when comparing different land management intensities. Considering these results, we argue that the general assumption that there is an almost direct relation between the capacity for ecosystem service provision of a given area and the actual ecosystem service provision is wrong. We also discuss how the framework presented here could be used to support land management and policy, and how it can be adapted for other regulating services.","AUG",2014

Disruption of pollinator movement is one hypothesis put forward to explain this pattern in pollen limitation. However, the small size of pollinators makes them very difficult to track; thus, knowledge of their movements is largely speculative. Using tiny radio transmitters (0.25 g), we translocated a generalist tropical 'trap-lining' hummingbird, the green hermit (Phaethornis guy), across agricultural and forested landscapes to test the hypothesis that movement is influenced by patterns of deforestation. Although, we found no difference in homing times between landscape types, return paths were on average 459+/-144 m (+/-s.e.) more direct in forested than agricultural landscapes. In addition, movement paths in agricultural landscapes contained 36+/-4 per cent more forest than the most direct route. Our findings suggest that this species can circumvent agricultural matrix to move among forest patches. Nevertheless, it is clear that movement of even a highly mobile species is strongly influenced by landscape disturbance. Maintaining landscape connectivity with forest corridors may be important for enhancing movement, and thus in facilitating pollen transfer.","43578",2009

The relationships between ecosystem services have commonly been characterized as tradeoffs and synergies. Here, we report that a third type of relationship also exists, in which one ecosystem service constrains the other. Selecting the grassland and agropastoral transitional zone of North China (GAPTZ) as the study area, we examined the relationships between paired ecosystem services: net primary productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), soil erosion by wind (SL), water yield (WY), and water retention (WR). The constraint effect of one ecosystem service on the other was determined by extracting the upper constraint lines from the scatter plots of the paired ecosystem services with segmented quantile regression on the levels of landscape, class, and ecoregion. Our results revealed eight types of constraint effects between the ten paired ecosystem services: (1) positive linear, (2) negative linear, (3) logarithmic, (4) negative convex, (5) backward S-shaped, (6) hump shaped, (7) convex-waved, and.(8) concave-waved. At the landscape, class, and ecoregion levels, there was a hump-shaped constraint effect between NPP and SC. Precipitation was the main factor shaping the constraint line of the paired NPP-SC. The gradually increasing constraint effect of higher NPP on WY indicated that, in arid and semiarid areas, improving NPP decreases water yield. In farmland areas, the backward S-shaped constraint line of the paired NPP-SL indicates that crops, unlike forests and grasslands, could not protect soil from wind erosion. The constraint effects of SL on WY and WR are negative convex on the landscape level and convex-waved or concave-waved on the class and ecoregion levels. The constraint line approach enriches the understanding of linkages between ecosystem services and the potential drivers. The constraint effects of ecosystem services have important implications for sustainable land use planning to optimize landscapes services. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","43525",2017

Network theory offers a highly informative framework to study the structural and functional attributes of complex interactions networks. We used information from bird fecal samples to build a quantitative seed dispersal network for the last fragment of native laurel forest in the island of So Miguel-Azores with three specific objectives: (1) to assess the integration of exotic seeds into seed dispersal; (2) to evaluate the impact of exotic plants in network structure; (3) to test the potential of an exotic species to reduce the seed dispersal of a co-occurring native, via competition for seed dispersers. The seed dispersal network was based on the analysis of 1,121 droppings and described 74 unique interactions between 41 plant species and 7 bird species. Exotic seeds deeply infiltrated into the seed dispersal network forming the majority (59 %) of seeds in the droppings and including those of three globally invasive plants. Overall, birds depended equally on native and exotic fruits despite the lower abundance of the latter in the study area. In an experiment, birds did not show a preference for fruits of the exotic Leycesteria formosa over the native Vaccinium cylindraceum consuming them equally. However, the presence of the exotic plant negatively affected the number of native seeds dispersed, by diverting some of the consumers of the native fruits.

In this study, we strive to achieve this type of conceptual understanding through the analysis of the relationships (e.g. strength, nonlinearity) between the trends of ecosystem services (ES) and human wellbeing (HWB) between 1960 and 2010 in the south-west Bangladesh delta using generalized additive and logistic regression models. We use sequential principal components analysis to investigate the connectedness within the social-ecological system as a measure of resilience. We also use published literature to help develop a system dynamic framework in order to investigate how ES and HWB are interlinked. Overall, our results support previous work, which depicts that material wellbeing (basic materials for a good life) having a strong relationship with provisioning services, which in turn, show a weak relationship with the quality of life (security and health). Moreover, our analysis confirms the 'Environmentalist's Paradox' that HWB has increased despite the deterioration in ES. However, our results suggest that provisioning services are not the only important reason for the increases in observed HWB, as these have also been substantially influenced by technology and capital investment (aid and subsidy). In addition, worsening trends in regulation services and in 'slow' variables such as climate suggest that the resilience of the overall social-ecological system is decreasing. Such changes may have severe consequences if they continue, for example, if temperatures exceed the upper physiological limits of key provisioning services (e.g. rice, fish) in the Bangladesh delta. These indicators all suggest that although in terms of HWB the deltaic social-ecological system may be successfully adapting to environmental change, it may also be close to transgressing critical ecological boundaries in the near future.",NA,2017

These mussels form a mutualistic relationship with smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora wherein the grass provides habitat and shade to the mussels, and the mussels stabilize the sediment and fertilize the grass. Salt marshes are, however, rapidly changing and eroding as humans modify the coast, and the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. In order to understand how ribbed mussels may respond to their changing habitat, we collected mussel density and distribution data from 30 marshes covering the range of geomorphic settings found in lower Chesapeake Bay. We used a combination of in situ and GIS-derived spatial variables to develop spatially applied models of ribbed mussel density and physical condition. Of the estimated 1.06 billion ribbed mussels in Virginia, we found that mussels were most abundant along the front edge of marshes in wide creeks, rivers, or bays with dense Spartina and minimal proximal forest, set in agriculturally dominated areas. In contrast, mussel condition was highest in fringing marshes located in narrow tidal creeks. Ribbed mussels responded to factors at a variety of scales, ranging from extremely local (0.5 m) to larger shorescapes (>= 300 m). The methods that we used to create models linking both aquatic and terrestrial variables to explain the variation in ribbed mussel populations along the shoreline provide a valuable tool for identifying baselines and assessing potential for change across estuary-level spatial scales not only for ribbed mussels in the Chesapeake Bay, but also for other sessile, intertidal species in other systems.","OCT",2018

It is an important habitat for a range of associated endemic species and provides vital natural resources to poor highland people, but these forests are threatened by over- exploitation and land management practices. Changes to Polylepis forests over a 50-year period in the Cordillera de Vilcanota, Perfi, were examined using air photographs and extensive field observations and photographs. Structured interviews were carried out with local farmers to record their perceptions of forest change over recent decades. Only about 1% of forest patches had been lost completely during the study period. There was no significant change in forest patch size, though larger patches tended to have denser canopies. Across all altitudes, about 10% of the forest showed a significant decline in canopy density, with very little forest showing the opposite trend. The majority of local farmers who were interviewed collected fuelwood from the forests and grazed their livestock there, but recognised the degradation these activities caused to canopy density and tree size. it is likely that the degradation of these forests over time has had an adverse impact on forest dynamics, associated biodiversity, ecological function and ecosystem services. More attention should be given to measuring and monitoring habitat quality of Polylepis forest, and conservation efforts should, in part at least, be refocused on protecting and enhancing the habitat quality of extant patches. However, habitat quality is difficult to define and measure, and presents a significant challenge to scientists, conservationists and local people. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The northwest arid region (NAR) in China is known as one of the most severe soil loss in the world that suffering from wind erosion. Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ), the spatio-temporal change of wind erosion was identified, and the underlying drivers and influencing factors of soil erosion process were investigated. In addition, the implications of constraint effects in soil erosion control were discussed. The results showed that the wind erosion from 1990 to 2013 was substantially lessened, and the government-aided desertification prevention and control programs, as well as increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed might have contributed to these trends. The constraint line analyses indicated that the vegetation cover had nonlinear and threshold effects on soil erosion through constraining the water condition (precipitation). Specifically, when the precipitation is below the threshold (approximately 50-100 mm yr(-1) in the NAR), the precipitation (water condition) is not sufficient to maintain a good vegetation cover (about 20-40%), therefore the vegetation cannot efficiently prevent wind erosion. However, once the precipitation exceeds this threshold, the vegetation's sand retention function will enhance and thereby reducing soil loss substantially. Vegetation cover has a lower and an upper threshold for controlling wind erosion. A plant cover lower than 10% does little to reduce wind velocity at the soil surface. The effect of vegetation on reducing wind erosion basically reaches the maximum when plant cover is 40% or above. The constraint effects of precipitation on vegetation cover in the arid region should be considered to improve the efficiency of afforestation and reforestation efforts aiming at mitigating and preventing soil loss.","FEB",2019

Geoffrey; Silow, Eugene; Sitoki, Lewis M.; Tamatamah, Rashid; McIntyre, Peter B.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","Climate warming is expected to have large effects on ecosystems in part due to the temperature dependence of metabolism. The responses of metabolic rates to climate warming may be greatest in the tropics and at low elevations because mean temperatures are warmer there and metabolic rates respond exponentially to temperature (with exponents > 1). However, if warming rates are sufficiently fast in higher latitude/elevation lakes, metabolic rate responses to warming may still be greater there even though metabolic rates respond exponentially to temperature. Thus, a wide range of global patterns in the magnitude of metabolic rate responses to warming could emerge depending on global patterns of temperature and warming rates. Here we use the Boltzmann-Arrhenius equation, published estimates of activation energy, and time series of temperature from 271 lakes to estimate long-term (1970-2010) changes in 64 metabolic processes in lakes. The estimated responses of metabolic processes to warming were usually greatest in tropical/low-elevation lakes even though surface temperatures in higher latitude/elevation lakes are warming faster. However, when the thermal sensitivity of a metabolic process is especially weak, higher latitude/elevation lakes had larger responses to warming in parallel with warming rates. Our results show that the sensitivity of a given response to temperature (as described by its activation energy) provides a simple heuristic for predicting whether tropical/low-elevation lakes will have larger or smaller metabolic responses to warming than higher latitude/elevation lakes. Overall, we conclude that the direct metabolic consequences of lake warming are likely to be felt most strongly at low latitudes and low elevations where metabolism-linked ecosystem services may be most affected.","MAY",2017

This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this' distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.","43631",2017

Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems.","MAR",2009

These changes in ecosystem services affect local communities' well-being and challenge users' adaptation capacities. We used the ecosystem services framework to understand the impacts of abrupt transformations, in a coastal wetland, associated to a similar to 1.6 meter coseismic uplift after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile. Using mixed methods we (1) identified and prioritized ecosystem services from Tubul-Raqui wetland; (2) assessed conditions of services and human well-being before and after the earthquake; (3) investigated postcatastrophe human adaptations and responses; and (4) explored users' interests and visions about possible future social-ecological pathways. Results show spatially diversified effects of the uplift on ecosystem services, both negative and positive, representing threats and opportunities for different user groups around the wetland. The total loss of the cultivated seaweed ""pelillo"" is associated with the most manifest reduction in perceptions of well-being among coastal users. Adaptive capacities triggered by pre-existing livelihood portfolios generated intensification in the exploitation of less impacted or enhanced ecosystem services which could be reducing resilience. Results show that two years after the transformation there is little attempt to create untried, new beginnings in the Tubul-Raqui wetland from which user groups could evolve to a more innovative livelihood and resource management system after the shift. Although visions about the future are not homogeneous among users, common interests regarding the conservation of key services are shared.

This study evaluates the success of salt marsh restoration using a Regulated Tidal Exchange (RTE) system in SW England, i.e., a self-regulating tidal gate (SRT), in controlling the partial saline inundation of a 14-ha area of former salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture in 1760. A combination of (a) direct hydrodynamic monitoring of water and sediment flux and (b) repeat surveys to evaluate morphological and ecological (plants and foraminifera) changes over a 5-year period, was implemented immediately following SRT commissioning. Morphological changes were limited to the proximity of the SRT system due to limited sediment influx yielding sedimentation rates that were an order of magnitude below a nearby natural marsh. Ecological change to an ephemeral salt marsh community was only detected after 5 years of inundation cycles, with the delayed response attributed to (a) an initial limited tidal inundation due to conservative SRT settings, followed by (b) excessive inundation due to excessive rainfall and recurring SRT failure in an open position, and (c) a lack of sediment and propagule supply caused by (a) & (b) and the relatively narrow inlet pipe used in the SRT system. While the ecological response under optimum SRT settings was encouraging, the lack of perennial plants and limited foraminifera abundance demonstrated that the marsh was far from reaching natural status. We surmise that this is primarily due to inundation being more rapid than drainage leading to excessive submergence during a tidal cycle. Our study shows that the design of tidal inundation schemes requires a synergistic understanding of core ecological and geomorphological approaches to assess viability and success. We conclude that SRT can be a useful technique for intertidal habitat creation where there are significant site constraints (especially flood risk), but we need to be realistic in our expectations of what it can achieve in terms of delivering a perennial salt marsh community.

Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.","43750",2016

Generally such catchment properties are based on low-resolution national datasets from low density urbanized basins and do not consider location, connectivity and patch size. Such factors are more routinely represented in landscape metrics employed in ecology, and could be particularly useful for representing the diversity of urban land-use. Here, hydrologically relevant landscape metrics are brought together with refined land-use classes and catchment descriptors routinely applied in UK flood estimation methods to estimate the median annual flood (QMED) in order to evaluate the potential role of such metrics. The results show that using higher resolution geospatial data can improve the representation of the urban environment, having particular effects on the delineation of urban water features and catchment area, but not urban extent. Refinement of landscape metrics based on correlations resulted in 12 metrics and 5 catchment descriptors being tested against observed QMED at 18 sites using a weighted least squares regression. The revised equation showed that certain landscape metrics can better represent the hydrological complexity of an urban catchment in a single distributed numerical form, leading to improved estimates of QMED over non-distributed descriptors, for the selected case study sites. The ability of landscape metrics to express connectivity and relative size and location of urban development promises significant potential for application in urban flood estimation and catchment-scale hydrological modelling.","JUL",2018

Between-patch dispersal of seeds by frugivores constitutes a key ecosystem function to ensure connectivity for fleshy-fruited plants. However, to date, methodological hurdles have limited our understanding of dispersal pathways on the landscape scale. We made use of newly available tracking devices and combined movement data of 30 trumpeter hornbills Bycanistes bucinator with gut passage times and high-resolution habitat data in a fragmented forest landscape in South Africa. We identified each potential seed dispersal path and distinguished whether potential seed transport happened to a different forest patch (between-patch dispersal), within the same patch (within-patch dispersal) or into the habitat matrix (failed dispersal). To quantify functional landscape connectivity, we identified all possible between-patch connections and used graph networks to estimate landscape connectivity provided by hornbills. Although potential between-patch dispersal events were rare (on average 7% compared to 20% failed dispersal and 73% within-patch dispersal), hornbills could cover distances of up to 15km. Hornbills visited over 100 forest patches and connected a habitat network with an extent of about 50km, which increased the potential functional connectivity of the landscape more than twofold. We identified habitat patches that were critical stepping stones for seed dispersal pathways. Without these stepping stones, the network would likely disintegrate into separated components and lead to isolation of forest fragments. Synthesis and applications. We showed that large frugivorous birds can greatly improve functional connectivity for fleshy-fruited plants across broad scales, linking habitat patches in fragmented forest landscapes. Combining high-resolution movement and landscape data in graph networks allows identifying seed dispersal pathways and critical stepping stones in fragmented landscapes. This approach addresses the general challenge of spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services and can be widely incorporated in reserve design and landscape-level conservation planning.","JUN",2014

Recommendations arising from such studies are best practices to achieve a balance between landscape aesthetic and ecological objectives, but many knowledge gaps still exist. In a social-ecological project in Greater London, appreciation of ponds and dragonflies in urban green spaces, and the environmental factors determining dragonfly diversity were investigated. We found ponds and their appearance were valued by people as enhancing their green space experience. The preference for wild-looking ponds was moderate. Dragonflies were enjoyed for their colour and high visibility, especially by those who had basic dragonfly knowledge. Species richness of dragonflies was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity in and around a pond. However, people were unable to relate a heterogeneous pond to more dragonfly species. For the first time, some factors that influence the human appreciation-ponds-dragonflies (HPD) relationship in an urban context are revealed.

We used rodent exclosures and embedded seed-addition experiments to evaluate the effects of rodent herbivory and granivory on populations of Tragopogon dubius, a Eurasian aster that typically occurs at low abundance across North America. Vegetation surveys encompassing 20 000 km2 of west-central Montana grasslands established that T. dubius is regionally well distributed, occurring in 81% of 16 grasslands sampled. However, it consistently occurred at low local abundance, averaging < 0.5% cover in 1 m2 plots. In large rodent exclosures, T. dubius attained population densities that averaged over five times higher than in paired rodent-access control plots at 11 grassland sites spread over 750 km2. This pattern was six times stronger in older compared with newer rodent exclosures, indicating enclosed populations were still increasing. Floral herbivory, which reduces or prevents reproduction in this biennial plant, decreased by 99% in rodent exclosures compared with control plots. Additionally, seedling establishment was nearly eight times higher in seed-addition subplots within versus outside of rodent exclosures. Synthesis.

Agroforestry systems are ideal for such experiments due to their increased uniformity and the relative ease with which factors can be manipulated and isolated. Manipulating the availability of food resources, we carried out an experimental test of this potential driver on bird diversity measures and the predatory services provided by birds in coffee agroforests. We constructed exclosures over coffee plants to measure arthropod removal intensity by birds comparing coffee agroforests with and without food resource (fruit) enrichment (the driver). Fruit enrichment agroforests had significantly greater bird species density (50%), overall abundance (55%), and abundance of understory insectivore specialists (89%) compared with control agroforests. Although 48 percent more arthropods were aspirated from coffee plants inside exclosures compared to coffee plants outside exclosures, fruit resource enrichment did not influence predatory activity by birds in the agroforests.

Defaunation is expected to interrupt plant-animal interactions with cascading effects for forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services. In a Central African forest first logged 35 years ago, we evaluated this process of ecological erosion in 30 study sites distributed across forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. Both logging and hunting tended to reduce abundances of large mammals, together shifting the relative abundance of the animal community towards squirrels and small birds. Through a series of experiments, we evaluated the effects of logging and hunting on seed dispersal, seed predation and herbivory. We demonstrate. that complete defaunation is not necessary to significantly alter the strength of plant-animal interactions. Hunting reduced the mean dispersal distances of nine mammal-dispersed tree species by 22%. Rates of seed predation were similar among forest types, but hunted forest had significantly lower rates of herbivory that we attribute to the lower abundance of meso-herbivores. Hunted forest also had significantly lower above-ground biomass (301 Mg ha(-1)) than the logged only (358 Mg ha(-1)) and undisturbed (455 Mg ha(-1)) forest types, but similar numbers of tree species and individuals. Lower biomass in hunted forest is likely attributable to significantly lower wood densities at small tree size classes (<40 cm). We hypothesize that over time the human-mediated modification of plant-animal interactions can alter the composition of the forest to have a higher proportion of fast-growing, low wood density tree species, diminishing the long-term potential for carbon storage.

To be most effective in achieving these goals, restoration efforts require knowledge of past conditions and drivers of change. We assessed landscape change in the Clear Creek, Iowa watershed from 1940 to 2002 using five metrics derived from aerial photos: land cover composition and configuration, housing density and spatial pattern, and stream sinuosity. Major cover changes in the watershed included increases in urban (+1743.0 ha) and dense forest cover (+618.9 ha), coupled with a decline in the total area (-2773.4 ha) and mean patch area (-4.9 ha) of crops. Mean forest patch area increased (+3.7 ha), while patch number declined by 21.1% as reforestation linked small, previously isolated patches. Housing density increased dramatically, and houses were increasingly clustered across the study period. Most new houses were added in urban areas. Main stream channel sinuosity ranged between 1.49 and 1.27; mean sinuosity decreased by 0.22 from 1940 to 1963, a decline that persisted until 2002. In combination, changes in these five metrics document shifts in landscape composition and configuration that have important implications for people and the landscape.

Landscape-level crop diversification is a promising tool for ecological intensification, whereby biodiversity and ecosystem services are enhanced, and pesticide applications reduced. Yet evidence for the effects of crop diversity at multiple scales and in different landscape contexts is lacking. Here, we investigate the potential benefits and context dependencies of multiscale crop diversity on natural enemies and overall biological control in winter wheat. Simultaneously, we examine the mediating effects of bird predation on aphid regulation in this system. 2. Eighteen conventional winter wheat fields were selected along two independent gradients of crop diversity and semi-natural habitat cover (SNH). We assessed biological control using a natural enemy exclusion experiment (""Open Treatment,"" ""Bird Exclosure,"" ""Full Exclosure""). Biological control, predator and parasitoid densities within cages were analysed as functions of landscape (crop diversity x SNH), bird predation (yes/no) and temporal change (three surveys) on six spatial scales (100-3,000 m). 3. Crop diversity rather than SNH enhanced aphid regulation in our study system. Biological control in fields with high landscape-level crop diversity was 8%-33% higher than in low-diversity landscapes, with main effects observed on scales <500 m. 4. Predator and parasitoid densities increased with crop diversity on small (100-250 m) and large (2,000-3,000 m) spatial scales respectively. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that natural enemies other than birds, parasitoids and aerial arthropods facilitated biological control.","SEP",2018

We studied survival in a shade tree give-away program in Sacramento, CA, monitoring a cohort of young trees for five years on single-family residential properties. We used conditional inference trees to identify the most important risk factors at different life history stages, and survival analysis to evaluate post-planting survivorship. Our analysis included socioeconomic, biophysical, and maintenance characteristics. In addition to field observations of tree planting status, survival, and maintenance, we also collected property ownership information through the Multiple Listing Service and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics from the U.S. Census. We found that 84.9% of trees were planted, with 70.9% survivorship at five years post-planting. Overall, 58.9% of delivered trees survived to five years, which the local program calls survivability. Planting rates were higher in neighborhoods with higher educational attainment, and on owner-occupied properties with stable residential ownership. Five-year survival was also higher for properties with stable homeownership, as well as for tree species with low water use demand. When we incorporated maintenance characteristics from the first year of field observations, factors related to tree care were important to survival. Many residents did not adhere to recommended maintenance practices. Our results illustrate the critical role of tree care and consistent homeownership to young tree mortality on residential properties, and suggest that survival assumptions in urban forest ecosystem services models may be overly optimistic.

"Travis",420,0,"Sierra",NA,"Roth","Functional ecology and imperfect detection of species","Roth, Tobias; Allan, Eric; Pearman, Peter B.; Amrhein, Valentin","METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","1. Functional traits are increasingly being used to understand the response of species to environmental change and their effects on ecosystem functioning. However, some ecologically important traits, such as plant height, influence the probability of species detection during field surveys. Imperfect detection of species could therefore bias measures of functional trait composition and diversity, leading to incorrect estimates of trait-environment relationships due to a process of detection filtering. The importance of detection filtering for functional ecological studies remains unknown. 2. We used hierarchical models that account for detection filtering to analyse data on 1,296 vascular plant species sampled in 362 1-km(2) plots, distributed along a 2,460-m elevational gradient in Central Europe. We examined how detection filtering altered measures of functional diversity (multivariate functional richness and packing) and composition (community means of three traits). We also determined whether the strength of detection filtering varied over the gradient, to determine whether detection filtering biased trait-environment relationships. 3. Species detectability was correlated with all three functional traits tested in this study, meaning that short species with small seeds and high specific leaf area values were less likely to be detected. This suggests that imperfect detection has the potential to bias measures of functional composition. Generally, measures of functional composition were not strongly affected by detection filtering, but functional packing was underestimated when detection filtering was not accounted for. In addition to the traits, distributional characteristics were important; rare species and species occurring mainly at low elevations tended to have lower detection probabilities. 4. Overall, detection filtering did not strongly bias trait-environment relationships because the effects of the environment on functional composition and diversity were larger than the effects of detection. 5. Our results suggest that many measures of functional composition and diversity are robust to detection filtering, but some are likely biased. Functional ecologists should consider correcting for imperfect detection, and our approach provides a simple method to do so for a wide range of datasets.","APR",2018

Researchers in diverse fields have suggested that complex systems do not have single stable equilibria in the long term because of inevitable perturbation. During this study, we sought to address the general question of whether or not stable social-ecological equilibria exist in highly stressed and managed lacustrine systems. Using an integrated human-biophysical model, we investigated the impacts of a species invasion and ecosystem restoration on SES equilibrium, defined here as a compromise in phosphorus management among opposing stakeholders, in western Lake Erie. Our integrated model is composed of a calibrated ecological submodel representing Sandusky Bay, and a phosphorus management submodel that reflects the societal benefits and costs of phosphorus regulation. These two submodels together form a dynamic feedback loop that includes freshwater ecology, ecosystem services, and phosphorus management. We found that the invasion of dreissenid mussels decreased ecosystem resistance to eutrophication, necessitating increased phosphorus management to preserve ecosystem services and thus creating the potential for a shift in social-ecological equilibrium. Additionally, our results suggest that net benefits in the region following the invasion of dreissenids may never again reach the pre-invasion level if on-site phosphorus control is the sole management lever. Further demonstrating transient system stability, large-scale wetland restoration shifted points of management compromise to states characterized by less on-site phosphorus management and higher environmental quality, resulting in a significant increase in net benefits in the region. We conclude that lacustrine SESs are open and dynamic, and we recommend that future models of these systems emphasize site-specific perturbation over equilibrium, thereby aiding the development of management plans for building system resistance to undesirable change that are both flexible and sustainable in an unknowable future.",NA,2010

For this we need to develop targeted management solutions that provide critical resources to service-providing organisms at the right time and place. We tested whether annual strips of early flowering phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia support pollinators and natural enemies of seed weevils Protapion spp., by attracting and offering nectar and pollen before the crop flowers. This was expected to increase yield of red clover Trifolium pratense seed. We monitored insect pollinators, pests, natural enemies and seed yields in a total of 50 clover fields along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, over 2years and across two regions in southern Sweden. About half of the fields were sown with flower strips of 125-2,000m(2). The clover fields were pollinated by 60% bumble bees Bombus spp. and 40% honey bees Apis mellifera. The clover seed yield was negatively associated with weevil density, but was unrelated to bee species richness and density. Flower strips enhanced bumble bees species richness in the clover fields, with the strongest influence in heterogeneous landscapes. There were few detectable differences between crop fields with and without flower strips. However, long-tongued bumble bees were redistributed toward field interiors and during phacelia bloom honey bees toward field edges. Clover seed yield also increased with increasing size of the flower strip. We conclude that annual flower strips of early flower resources can support bumble bee species richness and, if sufficiently large, possibly also increase crop yields. However, clover seed yield was mainly limited by weevil infestation, which was not influenced by the annual flower strips. A future goal should be to design targeted measures for pest control.","AUG",2018

They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. 'forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.","SEP",2011

In the Colorado River estuary, where upstream water diversions have limited freshwater input during the last century, mollusc remains from the last several hundred years suggest widespread ecological change. The once abundant clam Mulinia modesta has undergone population declines of approximately 94% and populations of predators relying on this species as a food source have probably declined, switched to alternative prey species or both. We distinguish between the first two hypotheses using a null model of predation preference to test whether M. modesta was preyed upon selectively by the naticid snail, Neverita reclusiana, along the estuary's past salinity gradient. To evaluate the third hypothesis, we estimate available prey biomass today and in the past, assuming prey were a limiting resource. Data on the frequency of drill holes-identifiable traces of naticid predation on prey shells-showed several species, including M. modesta, were preferred prey, Neverita reclusiana was probably able to switch prey. Available prey biomass also declined, suggesting the N. reclusiana population probably also declined. These results indicate a substantial change to the structure of the benthic food web. Given the global scale of water management, such changes have probably also occurred in many of the world's estuaries.","43615",2018

Such interactions are especially complex in tropical ecosystems, including endangered peat forests of Central Borneo, a biodiversity hot spot and home to the critically endangered orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We combined studies of the digestive physiology of captive orangutans in Australia with detailed field studies of wild orangutans in the Natural Laboratory of Peat-Swamp Forest of Sabangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. By measuring the gut transit time (TT) of indigestible seed mimics (beads) in captivity and applying this as a temporal constraint to movement data of wild orangutans, we developed a mechanistic, time-explicit spatial model to project the seed dispersal patterns by these large-bodied, arboreal frugivores. We followed seven orangutans and established home range kernels using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) modelling. This allowed us to model individual orangutan movements and to adjust these models according to gut transit times to estimate seed dispersal kernels. Female movements were conservative (core ranges of 55 and 52 ha in the wet and dry seasons, respectively) and revisitation rates to the same location of n = 4 in each 24-h block. Male movements were more unpredictable, yielding fragmented core ranges and revisitation rates to the same location of only 1.2 times each 24 h; males also demonstrated large disjunctions where they moved rapidly over long distances and were frequently lost from view. Seed dispersal kernels were nested predictably within the core ranges of females, but not males. We used the T-LoCoH approach to analyse movement ecology, which offered a powerful tool to predict the primary deposition of seeds by orangutans, thereby providing a reliable method for making a priori predictions of seed dispersal dynamics by other frugivores in novel ecosystems.","43552",2018

The mountains that surround the city are covered with urban forest of different types. These forests are providing various ecosystem services for the urban and peri-urban population of the city. Apart from surface temperature regulating function of the green spaces of Addis Ababa, no quantitative assessment of the carbon sequestration and soil protection ecosystem services provided by the urban forest has been conducted to date. The aim of this study was to assess selected ecosystem services such as carbon storage potential, habitat support and soil erosion protection provided by different categories of urban forest of Addis Ababa. The result showed that carbon density in the study area varied with forest categories viz. 293tons/ha, 142tons/ha and 132tons/ha in the dense, medium and open forest types respectively. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index is3.24 for Junipers dominated forest, 2.98 for mixed forest and 2.76 for Eucalyptus dominated forest. The formation of soil erosion features is significantly different among the Eucalyptus forest, Juniperus forest and Mixed forest where high incidence of soil erosion was recorded in the Eucalyptus forest. Therefore, irrespective of the environmental factors such as slope, aspect and elevation differences, there is an association between Eucalyptus forest cover and high soil erosion features. To ensure sustainable supply of ecosystem services and maintain a balanced urban environment, all green spaces in the city should be ecologically networked and diversified. Therefore, assessment of ecosystem services provided essential information for effective planning of the green space in terms of species composition and interconnectivity.","JUN",2017

Predictive approaches traditionally model the weighted mean trait values of communities (CWMs) as a function of environmental gradients. However, most approaches treat traits as independent regardless of known tradeoffs between them, which could lead to spurious predictions. To address this issue, we suggest jointly modeling a suit of functional traits along environmental gradients while accounting for relationships between traits. We use generalized additive mixed effect models to predict the functional composition of alpine grasslands in the Guisane Valley (France). We demonstrate that, compared to traditional approaches, joint trait models explain considerable amounts of variation in CWMs, yield less uncertainty in trait CWM predictions and provide more realistic spatial projections when extrapolating to novel environmental conditions. Modeling traits and their co-variation jointly is an alternative and superior approach to predicting traits independently. Additionally, compared to a predict first, assemble later' approach that estimates trait CWMs post hoc based on stacked species distribution models, our assemble first, predict later' approach directly models trait-responses along environmental gradients, and does not require data and models on species' distributions, but only mean functional trait values per community plot. This highlights the great potential of joint trait modeling approaches in large-scale mapping applications, such as spatial projections of the functional composition of vegetation and associated ecosystem services as a response to contemporary global change.","MAR",2018

Geoff; Yu, Mukui","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION","Global change induced biodiversity loss has greatly affected ecosystem functioning, and thus the multiple services delivered by the ecosystem. Considerable recent works have focused on evaluating how species diversity changes impacts multiple ecosystem functions and services simultaneously (called ecosystem multifunctionality, EMF), but none of these evaluations were conducted in mixed shelterbelt ecosystems, which are valuable in providing multiple ecological benefits for coastal human settlements. Here, we measured the shelterbelt structure, plant species diversity, major individual ecosystem services and the EMFs of four single-species dominated mixed shelterbelts and a non-forested land along the coastal area of Eastern China and quantified how shelterbelt structure and plant species diversity affected EMF in a natural coastal scenario. Among the four mixed shelterbelts, the Populus nigra (PN) dominated mixture had significantly higher shelterbelt porosity and height, while Ligustrum compactum (LC) and Koelreuteria bipinnata (KB) dominated mixtures both had higher species richness. Concerning individual ecosystem services, the PN dominated mixture is statistically better at windbreak, C fixation and O-2 releasing, plant diversity maintenance, nutrient transformation and cycling services, while the Taxodium distichum (TD) dominated mixture does better in soil and water conservation, therefore we observed the highest EMF in the PN dominated mixture. Also, we found that both shelterbelt porosity and height had significant positive effects on EMF, while no relationship was detected between shelterbelt permeability and EMF. Plant species richness and Shannon-Wiener index had significantly positive effects on EMF, but Pielow index had no significant effect on EMF. This indicated that the vertical structure of shelterbelts played a more important role than horizontal structure concerning ecosystem functioning, and EMF was not only positively affected by species richness but also species heterogenicity. These results will be informative in the policy-making and functional management of the shelterbelts and deepen the understanding of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship under alternative environmental scenarios.

I built a general, integrative approach to focus on both land use and livelihood functions of crop landraces in the context of nontraditional, migration-related livelihoods amid global change. The research involved a multimethod, case-study design focused on a cultural landscape of maize, i.e., corn, growing in the Andes of central Bolivia, which is a global hot spot for this crop's agrobiodiversity. Central questions included the following: (1) What are major agroecological functions and food-related services of the agrobiodiversity of Andean maize landraces, and how are they related to cultural landscapes and associated knowledge systems? (2) What are new migration-related livelihood groups, and how are their dynamic livelihoods propelled through global change, in particular international and national migration, linked to the use and cultural landscapes of agrobiodiversity? (3) What are management and policy options derived from the previous questions? Combined social-ecological services as both cultivation and food resources are found to function in relation to the cultural landscape. Results demonstrated major variations of maturation-based, phenologic traits and food-use properties that are cornerstones of the landrace-level agrobiodiversity of Andean maize. Knowledge of these parameters is widespread. Linkage of these production and consumption functions yields a major insight into dynamics of Andean maize agrobiodiversity. Concurrently, this smallholder cultural landscape has become increasingly dependent on new rural conditions, especially increased livelihood diversification and migration amid growing peri-urban influences. Viability of landrace-level maize agrobiodiversity between 2006 and 2012 is shown to have occurred amid a transition toward the integral roles of multiple migration-related groups, namely women farmers, consumers, and local business owners; migrants; field caretakers; and local in-migrant laborers. The nontraditional social networks among these livelihood groups must be incorporated into analysis and planning of the design, participation, and monitoring of management and policy options for cultural landscapes ensuring the use, in situ conservation, and sustainability, including ecosystem services, of food plant landraces in global agrobiodiversity hot spots.",NA,2014
