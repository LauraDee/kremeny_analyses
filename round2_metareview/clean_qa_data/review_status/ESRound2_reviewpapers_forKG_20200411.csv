Kathryn,Aislyn,,Aguado,"Aguado, Mateo; Gonzalez, Jose A.; Bellott, Kr'sna; Lopez-Santiago, Cesar; Montes, Carlos",Exploring subjective well-being and ecosystem services perception along a rural-urban gradient in the high Andes of Ecuador,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,2018,"Understanding sociocultural perceptions about human-nature relationships is essential to promote collective responses for sustainable ecosystem management. This study explores the sociocultural factors that influence subjective well-being (measured by life satisfaction) and how ecosystem services are perceived in an area inhabited by the Kichwa people, for whom the ancient notion of Good Living (Sumak Kawsay) is active. We carried out 482 surveys in five villages along a rural-urban gradient in the province of Imbabura (Ecuador). Rural and urban people differed in their subjective valuations of well-being components and the sociocultural factors that most influence life satisfaction. We also detected changes along the rural-urban gradient regarding how these sociocultural and subjective well-being factors explain the degree of importance that local people attribute to different ecosystems services provided by high Andean ecosystems. Formal education, the perception of local ecological knowledge, and the use of the Kichwa language were identified as important sociocultural factors that explain the observed differences. Finally, we discuss the risks of the ongoing expansion of urban lifestyles for the conservation of Andean social-ecological systems, highlighting the importance of maintaining traditional practices and beliefs associated with the Kichwa culture."
Kathryn,Aislyn,,Cameron,"Cameron, Clint; Hutley, Lindsay B.; Friess, Daniel A.; Brown, Benjamin","Community structure dynamics and carbon stock change of rehabilitated mangrove forests in Sulawesi, Indonesia",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2019,"To date, discourse associated with the potential application of ""blue carbon"" within real-world carbon markets has focused on blue carbon as a mitigation strategy in the context of avoided deforestation (e.g., REDD+). Here, we report structural dynamics and carbon storage gains from mangrove sites that have undergone rehabilitation to ascertain whether reforestation can complement conservation activities and warrant project investment. Replicated sites at two locations with contrasting geomorphic conditions were selected, Tiwoho and Tanakeke on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. These locations are representative of high (Tiwoho, deep muds and silty substrates) and low (Tanakeke, shallow, coralline sands) productivity mangrove ecosystems. They share a similar management history of clearing and conversion for aquaculture before restorative activities were undertaken using the practice of Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR). Species diversity and mean biomass carbon storage gains after 10 yr of regrowth from the high productivity sites of Tiwoho (49.2 +/- 9.1 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) are already almost of one-third of mean biomass stocks exhibited by mature forests (167.8 +/- 30.3 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). Tiwoho's EMR sites, on average, will have offset all biomass C that was initially lost through conversion within the next 11 yr, a finding in marked contrast to the minimal carbon gains observed on the low productivity, low diversity, coral atoll EMR sites of Tanakeke (1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). These findings highlight the importance of geomorphic and biophysical site selection if the primary purpose of EMR is intended to maximize carbon sequestration gains."
Kathryn,Sierra,biocrust growth on two different substrates (kind of like abundance measurement),de Carvalho,"de Carvalho, Ricardo Cruz; dos Santos, Patricia; Branquinho, Cristina",Production of moss-dominated biocrusts to enhance the stability and function of the margins of artificial water bodies,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,2018,"Margins of water reservoirs associated with dams can have high-frequency tides, promoting soil erosion and nutrient leaching. We propose the use of biocrusts for restoration and ecological engineering purposes, due to their poikilohydric character, to stabilize reservoir margins. We promoted biocrust growth under controlled conditions, testing two types of substrate: native sand and organic substrate. After 2 months, biocrusts grew on organic substrate covering almost all the area, but not on native sand. This fast and easy nature-based solution for soil stabilization can be used as an environmental engineering tool in highly degraded sites."
Kathryn,Laura/Caitlin,,Garratt,"Garratt, Michael P. D.; Senapathi, Deepa; Coston, Duncan J.; Mortimer, Simon R.; Potts, Simon G.",The benefits of hedgerows for pollinators and natural enemies depends on hedge quality and landscape context,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,2017,"Ecological intensification advocates the harnessing of regulating and supporting ecosystem services to promote more sustainable food production, and this relies on effective management of non-cropped habitats. Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification."
Kathryn,Laurel,,Hastwell,"Hastwell, Graeme T.; Morris, E. Charles",Structural features of fragmented woodland communities affect leaf litter decomposition rates,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,2013,"Disruption to the physical structure of plant communities by habitat fragmentation can change microclimates, so leaf litter decomposition rates, being dependent on temperature and moisture, may also be affected. Similarly, smaller-scale structural features of plant communities can modify microclimates, and so may produce distinctive spatial patterns in decomposition rates. We investigated the effects of three types of structural feature having the potential to alter litter layer microclimates: fragmentation-induced modification that diminishes with distance from remnant edges (edge-core); concentric zones of locally modified conditions imposed by individual trees (Belsky-Canham); and highly localised abiotic modification collectively imposed by herbaceous plants (ground cover). We conducted a litter bag experiment in woodland remnants, testing whether the observed spatial variability in litter decomposition was attributable to one or more of these three structural features. The data provided the strongest support for the Belsky-Canham hypothesis, and the least support for the ground cover hypothesis. However, the hypotheses were not mutually exclusive, for each explained a component of the observed variability not explained by either of the other two. Proximity to remnant edge, proximity to trees, canopy light penetration, and ground cover density each explained part of the observed variability between plots. Decomposition rates did not differ with remnant area per se, for the effects of fragmentation were weak, and differed with cardinal direction. In contrast, the effects of individual trees were much stronger, and accounted for most of the between-plot variability. We found that litter decomposition rates in small remnants are only weakly affected by fragmentation, and we consider that the contributions of small remnants to landscape-scale functioning warrant closer attention."
Kathryn,Laura/Caitlin,CTW re-evaluated article for Q8; LD: measures biomass as a function but links to services are less clear.,Jacob,"Jacob, Aerin L.; Lechowicz, Martin J.; Chapman, Colin A.",Non-native fruit trees facilitate colonization of native forest on abandoned farmland,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,2017,"Ecological restoration of abandoned, formerly forested farmland can improve the delivery of ecosystem services and benefit biodiversity conservation. Restoration programs can involve removing isolated, non-native trees planted by farmers for fruit or wood. As such legacy trees can attract seed dispersers and create microclimates that help native seedlings to establish, removing them may actually slow forest recovery. Working on abandoned farmland in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we evaluated the effect of legacy trees on forest recovery by measuring the number, diversity, and biomass of native seedlings and saplings regenerating in plots centered on avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), and Eucalyptus legacy trees compared with adjacent plots without legacy trees. The assemblages of native, forest-dependent tree species in plots around avocado and mango trees were distinct from each other and from those around eucalyptus and all the near-legacy plots. In particular, avocado plots had higher stem density and species richness of forest-dependent species than near-avocado plots, particularly large-seeded, shade-tolerant, and animal-dispersed species-key targets of many restoration plans. Furthermore, many of the species found in high numbers were among those failing to establish in ongoing large-scale forest restoration in Kibale. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the legacy trees facilitate the dispersal and establishment of native tree species. Retaining the existing legacy trees for a number of years could usefully complement existing management strategies to restore more biodiverse native forest in degraded lands. However, careful monitoring is needed to ensure that the legacy trees do not themselves establish."
Kathryn,Sierra,,Jones,"Jones, Faith A. M.; Magurran, Anne E.",Dominance structure of assemblages is regulated over a period of rapid environmental change,BIOLOGY LETTERS,2018,"Ecological assemblages are inherently uneven, with numerically dominant species contributing disproportionately to ecosystem services. Marked biodiversity change due to growing pressures on the world's ecosystems is now well documented. However, the hypothesis that dominant species are becoming relatively more abundant has not been tested. We examined the prediction that the dominance structure of contemporary communities is shifting, using a meta-analysis of 110 assemblage timeseries. Changes in relative and absolute dominance were evaluated with mixed and cyclic-shift permutation models. Our analysis uncovered no evidence of a systematic change in either form of dominance, but established that relative dominance is preserved even when assemblage size (total N) changes. This suggests that dominance structure is regulated alongside richness and assemblage size, and highlights the importance of investigating multiple components of assemblage diversity when evaluating ecosystem responses to environmental drivers."
Kathryn,Aislyn,,Luz Caleno-Ruiz,"Luz Caleno-Ruiz, Blanca; Rodriguez-Eraso, Nelly; Lopez-Camacho, Rene",Understanding the nursery habitat and provision service of a NTFP in a Colombian oak forest: A case of a nomadic vine,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,2018,"The conservation of ecosystems and associated services depends on an understanding of the ecological process. Research has centered on regulation services with little research in support services such as nursery habitat and provisioning of non-timber forest products (NTFP). We evaluate structural characteristics of 210 trees of ten species of ecological importance from a Colombian oak forest and their relation to Philodendron longirrhizum (Araceae) and its production of aerial roots to obtain fibers. This species was present in the majority of forest tree species, the structural characteristics of the trees were not distinguished between hosts and non-hosts and the rugosity of the bark and diameter of the trunk of the host species influenced the number of total and harvestable roots. The nursery habitat offered by the oak forest results from the mechanism that P. longirrhizum uses to climb over a wide variety of hosts, and the provisioning service is fostered by larger host trees that favor the production of roots. For the management of P. longirrhizum we suggest the establishment of individuals over the majority of trees if the aim is the enrichment and the establishment of individuals on larger trees if the aim is to increase the production of fiber.

Kathryn,Laura/Caitlin,,Masselink,"Masselink, Gerd; Hanley, Mick E.; Halwyn, Anissa C.; Blake, Will; Kingston, Ken; Newton, Thomas; Williams, Mike","Evaluation of salt marsh restoration by means of self-regulating tidal gate - Avon estuary, South Devon, UK",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,2017,"Salt marshes provide important regulating ecosystem services, including natural flood defence and carbon sequestration, which adds value to restoration and biodiversity offsetting schemes. This study evaluates the success of salt marsh restoration using a Regulated Tidal Exchange (RTE) system in SW England, i.e., a self-regulating tidal gate (SRT), in controlling the partial saline inundation of a 14-ha area of former salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture in 1760. A combination of (a) direct hydrodynamic monitoring of water and sediment flux and (b) repeat surveys to evaluate morphological and ecological (plants and foraminifera) changes over a 5-year period, was implemented immediately following SRT commissioning. Morphological changes were limited to the proximity of the SRT system due to limited sediment influx yielding sedimentation rates that were an order of magnitude below a nearby natural marsh. Ecological change to an ephemeral salt marsh community was only detected after 5 years of inundation cycles, with the delayed response attributed to (a) an initial limited tidal inundation due to conservative SRT settings, followed by (b) excessive inundation due to excessive rainfall and recurring SRT failure in an open position, and (c) a lack of sediment and propagule supply caused by (a) & (b) and the relatively narrow inlet pipe used in the SRT system. While the ecological response under optimum SRT settings was encouraging, the lack of perennial plants and limited foraminifera abundance demonstrated that the marsh was far from reaching natural status. We surmise that this is primarily due to inundation being more rapid than drainage leading to excessive submergence during a tidal cycle. Our study shows that the design of tidal inundation schemes requires a synergistic understanding of core ecological and geomorphological approaches to assess viability and success. We conclude that SRT can be a useful technique for intertidal habitat creation where there are significant site constraints (especially flood risk), but we need to be realistic in our expectations of what it can achieve in terms of delivering a perennial salt marsh community.

Kathryn,Julie,Soil ES responses to land management practices,Ndou,"Ndou, Esther; Ruwanza, Sheunesu",Soil and vegetation recovery following alien tree clearing in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,"The impact of alien tree clearing on soil and vegetation recovery remains largely understudied. This study focused on changes in soil and vegetation properties following Acacia removal. The aim was to quantify the long-term consequences of alien clearing. Paired cleared (old 15 years; medium - 11 years; recent - 6 years) and uncleared sites were selected along the Palmiet catchment in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Various soil physico- chemical properties (soil moisture, pH, P, N, C, K, Na, Ca, Mg and soil repellency) and vegetation diversity measures were studied on 10 m 9 10 m plots. Results indicate that measured soil nutrients are significantly (P < 0.05) lower in cleared than in uncleared sites. However, comparisons among cleared sites alone indicate that soil properties are recovering with older cleared sites having higher (P < 0.05) nutrients than recent cleared sites. Soils in uncleared sites are more repellent than soil in cleared sites. Vegetation recovery in cleared sites was taking place with older cleared sites having higher native species diversity than recently cleared site. We conclude that the removal of alien plants could have caused a reduction in soil nutrients. However, as native vegetation recovers on cleared sites, soil nutrients are gradually improving."
Kathryn,Grant,,Norkko,"Norkko, Joanna; Reed, Daniel C.; Timmermann, Karen; Norkko, Alf; Gustafsson, Bo G.; Bonsdorff, Erik; Slomp, Caroline P.; Carstensen, Jacob; Conley, Daniel J.",A welcome can of worms? Hypoxia mitigation by an invasive species,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2012,"Invasive species and bottom-water hypoxia both constitute major global threats to the diversity and integrity of marine ecosystems. These stressors may interact with unexpected consequences, as invasive species that require an initial environmental disturbance to become established can subsequently become important drivers of ecological change. There is recent evidence that improved bottom-water oxygen conditions in coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea coincide with increased abundances of the invasive polychaetes Marenzelleria spp. Using a reactive-transport model, we demonstrate that the long-term bioirrigation activities of dense Marenzelleria populations have a major impact on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics. This may facilitate the switch from a seasonally hypoxic system back to a normoxic system by reducing the potential for sediment-induced eutrophication in the upper water column. In contrast to short-term laboratory experiments, our simulations, which cover a 10-year period, show that Marenzelleria has the potential to enhance long-term phosphorus retention in muddy sediments. Over time bioirrigation leads to a substantial increase in the iron-bound phosphorus content of sediments while reducing the concentration of labile organic carbon. As surface sediments are maintained oxic, iron oxyhydroxides are able to persist and age into more refractory forms. The model illustrates mechanisms through which Marenzelleria can act as a driver of ecological change, although hypoxic disturbance or natural population declines in native species may be needed for them to initially become established. Invasive species are generally considered to have a negative impact; however, we show here that one of the main recent invaders in the Baltic Sea may provide important ecosystem services. This may be of particular importance in low-diversity systems, where disturbances may dramatically alter ecosystem services due to low functional redundancy. Thus, an environmental problem in one region may be either exacerbated or alleviated by a single species from another region, with potentially ecosystem-wide consequences."
Kathryn,Laurel,,Pinsky,"Pinsky, Malin L.; Guannel, Greg; Arkema, Katie K.",Quantifying wave attenuation to inform coastal habitat conservation,ECOSPHERE,2013,"Coastal vegetation can protect people and property from erosion and flooding, potentially providing a win-win solution for conservation and development. However, the conditions under which natural habitats provide protection have been controversial, partly because the geomorphic, ecological, and hydrodynamic factors that determine wave attenuation vary greatly among locations, times, and studies. We re-analyzed existing wave attenuation studies in kelp, mangrove, marsh and seagrass habitats and found that much of the variation in wave attenuation can be explained by differences in vegetation characteristics and by the change in bulk drag with flow conditions. We found that vegetation can exert substantial drag on passing waves, but that the bulk drag coefficient declines in flow conditions characterized by high Reynolds numbers. This decline is important because storm conditions are highly turbulent (typical Reynolds numbers are greater than 10 4), and we lack empirical measurements of bulk drag coefficients from such conditions. Failing to account for the decline can over-estimate wave attenuation in storms by 19% to 1600%. These results suggest that larger habitat areas will need to be set aside for coastal protection than previously thought. Our approach provides predictions for designing practical habitat conservation and restoration plans that also protect humans and property from flooding and erosion."
Kathryn,Isabel,,Rusch,"Rusch, Adrien; Delbac, Lionel; Thiery, Denis",Grape moth density in Bordeaux vineyards depends on local habitat management despite effects of landscape heterogeneity on their biological control,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2017,"1. Biological control of crop pests is a major ecosystem service affected by several variables acting at multiple spatial scales. Among these variables, heterogeneity at the habitat and landscape scales are known key drivers of trophic interactions and pest density in agroecosystems. However, studies that try to disentangle their relative effects in perennial cropping systems are scarce and nothing is known about their impacts on insect pest density and pesticide applications. 2. We examined the effect of heterogeneity at these two scales on grape moths, one of the most damaging insect pests in European vineyards, and their biological control in 20 vineyards during three consecutive years. We used local vegetation management and the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape as proxies of heterogeneity at the habitat and landscape scales. Grape moth density was measured over time, as well as biological control services provided by different groups: birds, invertebrate predators, parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi. 3. Over the 3 years, grape moth density was mainly determined by local heterogeneity, with significantly fewer larvae of the first generation established in vineyards with full compared to partial grass cover. 4. Despite these effects, biological control of grape moths was not primarily affected by local vegetation management but by landscape heterogeneity, and the direction of this effect varied over time. Notably, predation by birds increased with landscape heterogeneity in spring, depending on local vegetation management, while attacks by pathogenic fungi decreased with landscape heterogeneity during winter. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that bottom-up processes related to habitat heterogeneity drive grape moth occurrence much more than top-down processes. These results have important implications for the ecological intensification of vineyard landscapes. We found that maintaining full grass cover within vineyards reduced grape moth density to a level below common intervention thresholds. Landscape heterogeneity in the close vicinity of vineyards contributed to improved biological pest control by birds, but depended on local vegetation management. Moreover, opposing effects of landscape management on biological pest control services over time revealed that strategies based only on manipulating landscape heterogeneity might not be the optimal option to limit grape moth density in vineyards."
Kathryn,Isabel,,Tromeur,"Tromeur, Eric; Loeuille, Nicolas",Balancing yield with resilience and conservation objectives in harvested predator-prey communities,OIKOS,2017,"The global overexploitation of fish stocks is endangering many marine food webs. Scientists and managers now call for an ecosystem-based fisheries management, able to take into account the complexity of marine ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services they provide. By contrast, many fishery management plans only focus on maximizing the productivity of harvested stocks. Such practices are suggested to affect other ecosystem services, altering the integrity and resilience of natural communities. Here we show that while yield-maximizing policies can allow for coexistence and resilience in predator-prey communities, they are not optimal in a multi-objective context. We find that although total prey and predator maximum yields are higher with a prey-oriented harvest, focusing on the predator improves species coexistence. Also, moderate harvesting of the predator can enhance resilience. Furthermore, increasing maximum yields by changing catchabilities improves resilience in predator-oriented systems, but reduces it in prey-oriented systems. In a multi-objective context, optimal harvesting strategies involve a general tradeoff between yield and resilience. Resilience-maximizing strategies are however compatible with quite high yields, and should often be favored. Our results further suggest that balancing harvest between trophic levels is often best at maintaining simultaneously species coexistence, resilience and yield."
Kathryn,Grant,tsunami protection,Venkatachalam,"Venkatachalam, A. J.; Kaler, J.; Price, A. R. G.",Modelling ecological and other risk factors influencing the outcome of the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka,ECOSPHERE,2012,"The 2004 Asian tsunami caused widespread devastation across the Indian Ocean. Damage from the waves was influenced by complex interplay of many factors. Using regression models incorporating different impact indicators (occurrence of inundation, inundation distance, and human deaths), we examined factors that significantly influenced tsunami damage in southern Sri Lanka. Land elevation (which is positively correlated with forest presence), sand dunes and coastal convexity (which deflects waves), were protective factors, in terms of whether the tsunami wave inundated within an arbitrary distance of 15 m inland. Water bodies, saltpans and built-up areas (e. g., roads, development) increased wave inundation distance, while beaches and sand dunes were ameliorative. Built-up areas also increased death toll. Bathymetry, a proxy for wave height and force, was the only significant factor in all three multivariable models. Coastal areas with a steeper seaward bathymetric slope gradient were less prone to inundation and human fatalities, which is consistent other tsunami research. The presence of coral reefs was highly correlated with bathymetric slope gradient, implying a potentially protective role by coral reefs. Many factors showing greatest protective effect against tsunami damage are geographical features that cannot easily be modified. However, some defence factors identified, such as sand dunes, could potentially be protected. Given the wide-ranging ecosystem services, unrelated to tsunami protection, ongoing loss/degradation of natural systems including mangroves (not a significant factor in the multivariable models), could be damaging. This might impede certain future coastal development options in post-tsunami Sri Lanka."
Kathryn,Sierra,,Walker,"Walker, Emily A.; Lundholm, Jeremy T.",Designed habitat heterogeneity on green roofs increases seedling survival but not plant species diversity,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2018,"1. Urban areas benefit from the ecosystem services provided by low input green roofs. However, limited substrate depth on these green roofs creates challenging conditions for plant establishment and survival, leading to industry reliance on non-native succulents. 2. Through a green roof and glasshouse study, we assessed the impact of simple design modifications to the green roof surface, including redistribution of substrate and addition of logs and pebble piles, on both substrate temperature and moisture content. We added seeds of 26 native species and quantified seedling density, species richness and composition over a single growing season. Overall effects of microsite heterogeneity on species diversity were assessed using species accumulation curves. 3. The modifications altered substrate temperature and moisture. Deep substrate (10-12 cm) and the presence of surface features reduced the temperature by 14.6 degrees C and, while surface features had mixed effects on substrate moisture on the green roof, pebble piles slowed moisture loss during a 6-week drought in the glasshouse. 4. Following drought conditions, seedling density and species richness were greatest, relative to seeded controls, where substrate was deep on the green roof and where pebbles were present in glasshouse modules, despite high mortality overall. Design modifications did not result in differentiation of seedling communities among different microsite types. Species accumulation curves showed no difference in species richness between aggregates of modified vs. unaltered microsites. 5. Synthesis and applications. Redistribution of green roof substrate and the addition of logs and pebble piles altered microsite conditions and created habitat heterogeneity on a green roof. These design modifications represent a minimalist strategy to ameliorate growing conditions, improve seedling survival and decrease species loss on shallow substrate green roofs."

Earlier declines in marine resources, combined with current fishing pressures and devastating coral mortality in 2015, have resulted in a degraded coral reef ecosystem state at Puako in West Hawai'i. Changes to resource management are needed to facilitate recovery of ecosystem functions and services. 2. We developed a customised ecosystem model to evaluate the performance of alternative management scenarios at Puako in the provisioning of ecosystem services to human users (marine tourists, recreational fishers) and enhancing the reef's ability to recover from pressures (resilience). 3. Outcomes of the continuation of current management plus five alternative management scenarios were compared under both high and low coral-bleaching related mortality over a 15-year time span. 4. Current management is not adequate to prevent further declines in marine resources. Fishing effort is already above the multispecies sustainable yield, and, at its current level, will likely lead to a shift to algal-dominated reefs and greater abundance of undesirable fish species. Scenarios banning all gears other than line fishing, or prohibiting take of herbivorous fishes, were most effective at enhancing reef structure and resilience, dive tourism, and the recreational fishery. Allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders, with positive gains in both ecosystem resilience and dive tourism, while only moderately decreasing fishery value within the area. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our customised ecosystem model projects the impacts of multiple, simultaneous pressures on a reef ecosystem. Trade-offs of alternative approaches identified by local managers were quantified based on indicators for different ecosystem services (e.g. ecosystem resilience, recreation, food). This approach informs managers of potential conflicts among stakeholders and provides guidance on approaches that better balance conservation objectives and stake-holders' interests. Our results indicate that a combination of reducing land-based pollution and allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders and will enhance reef recovery from the detrimental effects of coral bleaching events that are expected over the next 15 years."
Kathryn,Aislyn,,Yates,"Yates, Adam G.; Culp, Joseph M.; Armanini, David G.; Baird, Donald J.; Jardine, Timothy D.; Orlofske, Jessica M.",Enhancing bioassessment approaches: development of a river services assessment framework,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,2019,"There has been a trend toward increasing anthropocentrism in definitions of river health through the explicit inclusion of societal valuation of ecosystem services provided by rivers. New frameworks and associated indicators of river health are therefore required to centralize ecosystem services within river assessment and management activities. Here, we adopt an anthropocentric conceptualization of rivers to focus on a river's ability to maintain ecological function and structure that support ecosystem services valued by society. We apply this approach to further existing conceptual models of river assessment by identifying how benthic indicators can be linked to valued ecosystem services in a river services assessment framework. This approach extends bioassessment from a focus on assessing departure from reference condition to also include the evaluation of rivers based on their delivery of ecosystem services. Indicators based on benthic processes and assemblages are widely used in river health assessments; thus, these are reviewed to identify those indicators most closely linked with the provision of river ecosystem services. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can be applied to management through contrasting watershed examples, including a highly modified agricultural region and relatively pristine Arctic watersheds. The proposed approach supports an explicit connection between valued ecosystem services and benthic indicators, providing more targeted assessment results for use in river management decision-making."

Successional stage is likely to influence forest productivity and carbon storage, linking the degree of forest disturbance to the global carbon cycle and climate. Although tropical montane forests are an important part of tropical forest ecosystems (ca. 8 %, elevation > 1000m a.s.l.), there are still significant knowledge gaps regarding the carbon dynamics and stocks of these forests, and how these differ between early (ES) and late successional (LS) stages. This study examines the carbon (C) stock, relative growth rate (RGR) and net primary production (NPP) of ES and LS forest stands in an Afromontane tropical rainforest using data from inventories of quantitatively important ecosystem compartments in fifteen 0.5 ha plots in Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda. The total C stock was 35% larger in LS compared to ES plots due to significantly larger above-ground biomass (AGB; 185 and 76MgC ha(-1) in LS and ES plots), while the soil and root C stock (down to 45 cm depth in the mineral soil) did not significantly differ between the two successional stages (178 and 204MgC ha(-1) in LS and ES plots). The main reasons for the difference in AGB were that ES trees had significantly lower stature and wood density compared to LS trees. However, ES and LS stands had similar total NPP (canopy, wood and roots of all plots similar to 9.4MgC ha(-1)) due to counterbalancing effects of differences in AGB (higher in LS stands) and RGR (higher in ES stands). The AGB in the LS plots was considerably higher than the average value reported for old-growth tropical montane forest of south-east Asia and Central and South America at similar elevations and temperatures, and of the same magnitude as in tropical lowland forest of these regions. The results of this study highlight the importance of accounting for disturbance regimes and differences in wood density and allometry of tree species dominating at different successional stages in an attempt to quantify the C stock and sink strength of tropical montane forests and how they may differ among continents."
Kathryn,Travis,,Orford,"Orford, Katherine A.; Vaughan, Ian P.; Memmott, Jane",The forgotten flies: the importance of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2015,"Bees, hoverflies and butterflies are taxa frequently studied as pollinators in agricultural and conservation contexts. Although there are many records of non-syrphid Diptera visiting flowers, they are generally not regarded as important pollinators. We use data from 30 pollen-transport networks and 71 pollinator-visitation networks to compare the importance of various flower-visiting taxa as pollen-vectors. We specifically compare non-syrphid Diptera and Syrphidae to determine whether neglect of the former in the literature is justified. We found no significant difference in pollen-loads between the syrphid and non-syrphid Diptera. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the level of specialization between the two groups in the pollen-transport networks, though the Syrphidae had significantly greater visitation evenness. Flower visitation data from 33 farms showed that non-syrphid Diptera made up the majority of the flower-visiting Diptera in the agricultural studies (on average 82% abundance and 73% species richness), and we estimate that non-syrphid Diptera carry 84% of total pollen carried by farmland Diptera. As important pollinators, such as bees, have suffered serious declines, it would be prudent to improve our understanding of the role of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators."
Kathryn,Isabel,model of ES seems more like a conceptual framework,Penaluna,"Penaluna, Brooke E.; Olson, Deanna H.; Flitcroft, Rebecca L.; Weber, Matthew A.; Bellmore, J. Ryan; Wondzell, Steven M.; Dunham, Jason B.; Johnson, Sherri L.; Reeves, Gordon H.",Aquatic biodiversity in forests: a weak link in ecosystem services resilience,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,2017,"The diversity of aquatic ecosystems is being quickly reduced on many continents, warranting a closer examination of the consequences for ecological integrity and ecosystem services. Here we describe intermediate and final ecosystem services derived from aquatic biodiversity in forests. We include a summary of the factors framing the assembly of aquatic biodiversity in forests in natural systems and how they change with a variety of natural disturbances and human-derived stressors. We consider forested aquatic ecosystems as a multi-state portfolio, with diverse assemblages and life-history strategies occurring at local scales as a consequence of a mosaic of habitat conditions and past disturbances and stressors. Maintaining this multi-state portfolio of assemblages requires a broad perspective of ecosystem structure, various functions, services, and management implications relative to contemporary stressors. Because aquatic biodiversity provides multiple ecosystem services to forests, activities that compromise aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity could be an issue for maintaining forest ecosystem integrity. We illustrate these concepts with examples of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services in forests of northwestern North America, also known as Northeast Pacific Rim. Encouraging management planning at broad as well as local spatial scales to recognize multi-state ecosystem management goals has promise for maintaining valuable ecosystem services. Ultimately, integration of information from socio-ecological ecosystems will be needed to maintain ecosystem services derived directly and indirectly from forest aquatic biota."

In particular, global climate is increasing sea levels and potentially altering storm intensities, which may result in increased risk of flooding in coastal areas. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), coastal dunes that protect the coast from flooding are largely the product of a grass introduced from Europe over a century ago (Ammophila arenaria). An introduced congener (A. breviligulata) is displacing A. arenaria and reducing dune height. Here we quantify the relative exposure to storm-wave induced dune overtopping posed by the A. breviligulata invasion in the face of projected multi-decadal changes in sea level and storm intensity. In our models, altered storm intensity was the largest driver of overtopping extent, however the invasion by A. breviligulata tripled the number of areas vulnerable to overtopping and posed a fourfold larger exposure than sea-level rise over multi-decadal time scales. Our work demonstrates the importance of a transdisciplinary approach that draws on insights from ecology, geomorphology, and civil engineering to assess the vulnerability of ecosystem services in light of global change."
Kathryn,Sierra,drivers of urban forest composition,Steenberg,"Steenberg, James W. N.",People or place? An exploration of social and ecological drivers of urban forest species composition,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,2018,"Urban forests have garnered increasing attention as providers of an array of beneficial ecosystem services. However, urban forest ecosystems are highly complex and heterogeneous systems whose structure are shaped by interacting social and ecological processes. Approaches to reliably identify and differentiate these processes could be valuable for addressing complexity and reducing uncertainty in decision-making in urban forestry. The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify a range of social and ecological drivers of urban forest species composition, distribution, and diversity. This was done using hierarchical cluster analysis and discriminant analysis with empirical plot data describing the tree species composition in Toronto, Canada. Tree density and imperviousness were by far the most influential drivers of species composition. Increasing imperviousness saw not just reduced tree density but a decline in native species abundance. Additionally, single-detached housing, homeownership, and income were closely associated and explained higher tree densities and abundances of native species. However, income had a lower than expected influence on urban forest species composition given its importance in canopy cover research. Continuous forest patches were highly distinct compared to the remainder of the urban landscape, which highlights the ecological distinctiveness of residual forests within cities and lends support to their conservation. Increasing the understanding of social and ecological drivers of tree species composition, distribution, and diversity within cities is an integral part of urban forest ecosystem classification, which can be a valuable decision-support tool for ecosystem-based management in urban forestry."

V.",Mammal diversity influences the carbon cycle through trophic interactions in the Amazon,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,2017,"Biodiversity affects many ecosystem functions and services, including carbon cycling and retention. While it is known that the efficiency of carbon capture and biomass production by ecological communities increases with species diversity, the role of vertebrate animals in the carbon cycle remains undocumented. Here, we use an extensive dataset collected in a high-diversity Amazonian system to parse out the relationship between animal and plant species richness, feeding interactions, tree biomass and carbon concentrations in soil. Mammal and tree species richness is positively related to tree biomass and carbon concentration in soil-and the relationship is mediated by organic remains produced by vertebrate feeding events. Our research advances knowledge of the links between biodiversity and carbon cycling and storage, supporting the view that whole community complexity-including vertebrate richness and trophic interactions-drives ecosystem function in tropical systems. Securing animal and plant diversity while protecting landscape integrity will contribute to soil nutrient content and carbon retention in the biosphere."

Rice cultivation is closely linked to socio-cultural values and has created specific agrobiodiversity. Increasing development pressures lead to an intensification of small-scale production systems and with this to changes of landscapes and associated ecosystems services. With a focus on cultural ecosystem services and along different land use gradients a qualitative assessment of farmer's perceptions regarding cultural values of their landscapes was conducted. Interviews focused on traditional farming methods and the abundance of cultural values and perceptions that support the preservation of low-input, sustainable land management strategies. 73 indicators for Cultural Identity, Landscape Aesthetics, and Knowledge Systems were derived, revealing that socio-cultural structures and the socioeconomic situation of farmers influence their view on landscape-related cultural services. The qualitative approach of this research provides an important contribution to the field of ecosystem service assessments because these are the values people perceive based on culturally embedded and socially shaped preferences. For the implementation of ecological engineering, which is based on participation and on the belief into the natural resilience of ecosystems, the assessment of cultural ecosystem services provides important evidence in which areas this theoretical concept could find higher acceptance.

Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change. Collectively, our results indicate that future changes in SOM and plant productivity, regulated by cascading effects of precipitation on freshwater availability and salinity, could impact wetland stability and affect the supply of some wetland ecosystem services."
Kathryn,Laura,,Tamburini,"Tamburini, Giovanni; Lami, Francesco; Marini, Lorenzo",Pollination benefits are maximized at intermediate nutrient levels,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2017,"Yield production in flowering crops depends on both nutrient availability and pollination, but their relative roles and potential interactions are poorly understood. We measured pollination benefits to yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25, 50, 100%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization (from 0 to 150 kg N ha(-1)) in an experiment under realistic soil field conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by approximately 25% compared with complete pollinator exclusion. Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were reduced by 50%, indicating that the incremental contribution of pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems. In particular, we found optimal level of pollination to potentially compensate for lower N applications."

Recognising these benefits, researchers are now examining the complex relationship between humans and nature in urban social-ecology. Most studies investigate people's appreciation and valuation of different green space features and their contribution to urban biodiversity. Recommendations arising from such studies are best practices to achieve a balance between landscape aesthetic and ecological objectives, but many knowledge gaps still exist. In a social-ecological project in Greater London, appreciation of ponds and dragonflies in urban green spaces, and the environmental factors determining dragonfly diversity were investigated. We found ponds and their appearance were valued by people as enhancing their green space experience. The preference for wild-looking ponds was moderate. Dragonflies were enjoyed for their colour and high visibility, especially by those who had basic dragonfly knowledge. Species richness of dragonflies was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity in and around a pond. However, people were unable to relate a heterogeneous pond to more dragonfly species. For the first time, some factors that influence the human appreciation-ponds-dragonflies (HPD) relationship in an urban context are revealed. To fully realise the CES potential of ponds and dragonflies in Greater London, a HPD framework is proposed. The framework underpins strategies that foster cultural sustainability for ponds and dragonfly conservation."
