We used digital methods to analyze coarse- and fine-scale change in the extent of riparian tree canopy along the entire stream network, and investigated potential drivers of change by 1) quantifying changes in land cover across the watershed through the use of aerial photography, 2) characterizing historical and current stream flows from stream gage data and field observations, and 3) evaluating the contribution of exotic species to riparian tree stem density via field sampling throughout the stream network",,1,,,,,"Terrestrial,Freshwater",No,Yes

Additionally, 3 manipulated seed core blocks installed per transect to assess predation and persistence rates. Each block 3m apart and alternated real and fake seed. Seed cores contained 4 depth levels of seed (0, 5, 15, and 30mm depths), and each block contained 5 seed cores (arrayed in pentagonal/star shape).
