2020-04-15,R_2S9uj14seoj3ZfG,AIS,A framework to quantify the strength of ecological links between an environmental stressor and final ecosystem services,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"This was a challenging paper for me to read. Its main message is proposing a framework, but the authors also apply this framework to a case study, which I based my answers in this survey off of. Between use of terminology I don't know and vague description of the data, I struggled to do this paper justice, I fear."

2020-04-15,R_SMB94nDu1Rxnw89,AK,An integrated ecological modeling system for assessing impacts of multiple stressors on stream and riverine ecosystem services within river basins,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,TRUE,"Honestly, this was a bit confusing. The paper mainly focused on the benefits of the model and the details of it. "
2020-04-15,R_3UXMx75t97OUqs1,AK,Arable weeds as indicators of agricultural intensity - A case study from Finland,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,I wasn't sure if this paper should've been included. It almost seems like it stops at biodiversity but it mentions implications for ES. Also - the paper quantified diversity for animal groups based on weed index. 
2020-04-15,R_12LTy7jbBE8ZpVJ,CW,"BIMBY's first steps: a pilot study on the contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix and Maastricht to biodiversity, ecosystem services and urban sustainability",Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"I'm not totally sure this paper should count towards our tallies for figure. X variables explaining ES provisioning are basically garden-design type and location (not an actual ESP or process). Table also report summary stats (e.g. % observed), not effect of type or location on the y-var. Study does quantify a variety of ES's though based on these two x variables and intro is clear in its intention about wanting to study factors that contribute to ES provisioning sensu Costanza and the MEA. It's also difficult to assess what ""Total Diversity"" encapsulates (is not ecological diversity) because it's a composite index from a Biodiversity in my backyard (BIMBY) framework, and methods doesn't state which metrics go into that index."
2020-04-15,R_T8b3xew0rVQL489,AIS,"Changes in landuse alter ant diversity, assemblage composition and dominant functional groups in African savannas",Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,TRUE,"almost marked ""yes"" on Q3"

2020-04-15,R_7P3SpB4PEitCRrP,IS,China's progress towards sustainable land degradation control: Insights from the northwest arid regions,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,this paper didn't explicitly talk about ecosystem functions or ecosystem services in general nor in terms of their measured variables so that is why I left the q12 'paper reported response variables as...' blank; it did stay in since it didn't quite fall into the initial exclusion questions in this qualtrics survey
2020-04-15,R_1q9Uf3ZTvvvgngD,AIS,"Citizens' voice: A case study about perceived ecosystem services by urban park users in Rotterdam, the Netherlands",Exclude,by survey notes,TRUE,"I think this paper should have been excluded in round 1 since it does not directly measure an EF/ES or a proxy, only human perception of ES"
2020-04-15,R_22WbXqkXbhN02fD,AK,"Citizens' voice: A case study about perceived ecosystem services by urban park users in Rotterdam, the Netherlands",Keep,NA,TRUE,"This paper didn't really have ""response variables"". Instead they looked at people's perceptions of services in urban parks, so everything was qualitative/descriptive. Wasn't sure how to express this in the big table!"
2020-04-15,R_2VPcco1o8T95nSu,AIS,"Demographic drivers of biomass carbon recovery in degraded perennial tussock grassland, with and without domestic grazing",Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"main focus of paper is on demographic processes, so considered excluding at first"
2020-04-15,R_26hhXZOzq4brDdp,AK,Effects of land-use change on wetland ecosystem services: A case study in the Donana marshes (SW Spain),Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"Didn't actually MEASURE services, but had expert panel weigh in on whether ES were improving or not based on land use change."
2020-04-15,R_31WydZ14DUuPl2O,AK,Environmental Conservation and Social Benefits of Charcoal Production in Mozambique,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,This paper was confusing...The response variables I listed were also drivers of change in well-being

2020-04-15,R_VKm39HpefI4YQNz,JL,How good are tropical forest patches for ecosystem services provisioning?,Exclude,by survey notes,FALSE,"The ES table is not filled out because the paper is only an ecosystem service valuation paper (no drivers). I believe that it thus would have been excluded in round 1, but there were no questions to explicitly exclude it in round 2, so I filled it out (plus it may address some interesting scale questions). Specifically, the paper maps 'forest ecosystem services' by using land cover data to estimate ES provision based on forest age, contiguity, and size, assuming that old, connected and larger forests provide more ES's. It measures no services directly, nor looks at any drivers that are not already implicit in their valuation approach."
2020-04-15,R_C4Fa36rH5EGVZZv,CW,"Modeling and predicting the growth of the mussel, Mytilus edulis: implications for planning of aquaculture and eutrophication mitigation",Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"This paper was tricky to evaluate. Talks about ES's (nutrient assimilation, production yield for aquaculture) but doesn't quantify anything related to them. Simply states that mussel growth is an EF (reader is to accept that) and that relates to ES's. It also doesn't show how different predictive variables relate to mussel growth rate, figures show overall model performance and AIC values.. I think this paper is more about methods for modeling and how accurate models are than trying to quantify ES provisioning, although map in results does show how mussel relative growth classes are distributed across space."
2020-04-15,R_12FO5dczVAGa2t4,GV,Multifunctionality of floodplain landscapes: relating management options to ecosystem services,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,"Had lots of variables, but only experts' assessment of the influence of the driver (intervention/management strategy) on the service. No direct measurement and largely abstract. Examined tradeoffs of different management strategies."
2020-04-15,R_2qrxD2YLG0as2i7,AK,Nitrogen-induced terrestrial eutrophication: cascading effects and impacts on ecosystem services,Exclude,by survey notes,FALSE,Consider excluding? I'm really not sure if this paper fits....I had a really hard time filling out this form since it was more of a synthesis. They also use/mention tons of indicators so I wasn't sure how to fill out the table in Q12
2020-04-15,R_2s4rK5FpVzBDFwp,JL,Recreational demand for clean water: evidence from geotagged photographs by visitors to lakes,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,May want Laura to review if this actually includes enough ecology to retain (on the fence about whether it is only the social dimension)
2020-04-15,R_2ZOYONA2GeCUPmP,TK,Resilience and stability of a pelagic marine ecosystem,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,FALSE,This one was really tough. The main goal was determining the source of the resilience of the particular ecosystem.

2020-04-15,R_3NWd3QmEMj1LFsb,JL,Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect pollinators in intensive grassland systems,Keep,NA,TRUE,"There were positive effects of management (fenced vs non-fenced riparian zones, wide vs narrow buffer riparian zones) on butterfly and bee ESPs; this could not be captured in the ES table because the direction of effect (+ or -) is not clear with categorical explanatory variables."

2020-04-15,R_2AScyHwfYiShxsW,LD,Traditional ecological knowledge and medicinal plant diversity in Ecuadorian Amazon home gardens,Keep,NA,TRUE,"The ""driver"" this study considers is human, but more about the characteristics of the individual people who garden and their knowledge levels of medicinal plants. The human drivers (extend of traditional knowledge)were focused on explaining the diversity of medicinal plants in gardens.  Striking finding: ""In Sangay, 91% of gardeners declare medicinal plants as their primary source of primary health care and their households have an average monthly income of 247 USD, an amount below the minimum wage in Ecuador (375 USD)."""

2020-04-15,R_1JUR42uFvFRgJC8,LD,Wetlands in agricultural landscapes for nitrogen attenuation and biodiversity enhancement: Opportunities and limitations,Keep,NA,TRUE,"Some key things to pull out: Denitrification(graybars)andnitrousoxideemission(blackbars)in6streamsidelocationsintheupper,middleandlowerpartsofthecatchmentsstudied. Of the environmen- tal factors measured, pH is definitely the one which gives the best explanation of these differences (Fig. 2). At all sites where nitrous oxide emissions occurred, pH values were low, whereas emissions were negligible or even negative where pH was around 7."
2020-04-15,R_1Ii1tA7vhIY11FI,TK,Wetlands in agricultural landscapes for nitrogen attenuation and biodiversity enhancement: Opportunities and limitations,Maybe,uncertainy in survey notes,TRUE,"Barely a data paper but did include one really small study that has barely any connection to ES. Not sure it should have made it through, but it is tough. Weird paper."
