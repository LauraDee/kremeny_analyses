In each plot, 5 sampling subplots (1m 1m) were established at a 15-m interval along a random transect. Within each subplot, the aboveground biomass and surface litter were harvested and collected separately. After the litter layer was removed, the belowground biomass was sampled from 5 sampling points down to a depth of 30 cm in the main rooting zone using a soil auger (5 cm in diameter) in each subplot. Soil samples were collected using a soil sampler (4 cm diameter) from 4 depths: 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cm. A composite soil sample was obtained for each depth using the soil collected at 3 sampling points in each subplot. Therefore, within each experimental plot, 5 composite soil samples were collected for each soil depth, yielding a total of 120 composite soil samples for all plots and depth","In this study, the C and N storages in different parts of the plant– soil system, the concentrations of soil MBC and MBN, and the relationships between soil organic matter and microbial biomass were compared between three fenced sites and the paired adjacent grazed sites in the Hulunbuir grassland of Inner Mongolia.
