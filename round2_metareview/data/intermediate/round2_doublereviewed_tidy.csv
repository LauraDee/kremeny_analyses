The study included lakes that were naturally acidified and lakes that were acidified due to human activity. It also included lakes that were limed by humans and ones that were not. So water quality was determined by natural and human causes. They were particularly interested in the human-caused liming. The human driver relationship was mixed because adding lime to lakes that were naturally acidified seemed to cause negative changes in community structure. Adding lime to lakes that were acidified due to human use probably had neutral to beneficial impacts from a management standpoint (water quality). For food and feed, the fisheries potential is responding to the community structure/water quality/human liming. They estimate fisheries potential from occurrence of valuable fish species. Q13  Kremen topic 3 is relevant because the paper does include - how community structure is different in naturally acidified lakes compared to unnaturally acidified lakes, but they do not delve into those details or discuss them at all.","Notes, Questions, Comments",SurveyNotes,NA,NA,NA,Q18,NA,212,FALSE

They were trying to tease apart taxon-specific effects. Interesting: The current observations of the impact of dor beetles offer large-scale proof for previous findings obtained at smaller spatial scales: that dung beetle species of high body mass may be disproportionately important for sustaining an overall ecosystem service in both temper- ate (Rosenlew and Roslin 2008) and tropical regions (Larsen et al. 2005, Slade et al. 2007, 2011). The fate of a major ecosystem service may then hinge disproportion- ately on the fate of individual, large-sized species—a finding with profound consequences for conservation priorities. Overall, we note that our general approach of estimating functional contributions of decomposer taxa as differences in mass among dung pats to which they had vs. lacked access relies on the explicit assumption that relevant taxa were present across sites. For pat- dwelling dung beetles in the genus Aphodius, this assumption was verified through direct sampling of five bait pats (see above and Appendix B). For earthworms and dor beetles, the sampling techniques employed will suffice to establish neither their presence nor their abundance. ****FLAG AS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SCALE UP ES RESEARCH - citizen science experiments *****","Notes, Questions, Comments",SurveyNotes,NA,NA,NA,Q18,NA,212,FALSE
