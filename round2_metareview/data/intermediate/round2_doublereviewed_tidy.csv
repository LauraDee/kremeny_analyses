The study included lakes that were naturally acidified and lakes that were acidified due to human activity. It also included lakes that were limed by humans and ones that were not. So water quality was determined by natural and human causes. They were particularly interested in the human-caused liming. The human driver relationship was mixed because adding lime to lakes that were naturally acidified seemed to cause negative changes in community structure. Adding lime to lakes that were acidified due to human use probably had neutral to beneficial impacts from a management standpoint (water quality). For food and feed, the fisheries potential is responding to the community structure/water quality/human liming. They estimate fisheries potential from occurrence of valuable fish species. Q13  Kremen topic 3 is relevant because the paper does include - how community structure is different in naturally acidified lakes compared to unnaturally acidified lakes, but they do not delve into those details or discuss them at all.","Notes, Questions, Comments",SurveyNotes,NA,NA,NA,Q18,NA,212,FALSE
